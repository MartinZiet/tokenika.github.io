Brendan Blumer's background: virtual currencies, video games, real estate. Blockchain since 2015.

2008: Bitcoin: trustless ledger

2014: Ethereum: generalized smart-contracts

The concept of decentralized autonomous organizations is born.

BTC & ETH unable to follow through on all of the visions.

Need a platform for high performance : millions of trxns per sec.

Huge gap between what we need and what we have.

BTC: 3 trxn/sec

ETH: 30 trxn/sec

> ETH max: 500k/day = 6/sec
> BTC max: 350k/day = 4/sec
>
> STM avg: 700k/day = 8/sec
> BTS avg: 100k/day = 1/sec
>
> ETH trxn fee: 0.3 USD
>
> BTC trxn fee: 3 USD
> BTC trxn fee per day: 1 mln USD
>
> BTC trxn cost: 40 USD
> BTC mining rev: 12 mln USD / day
>
> EOS witness pay at 1 bln USD evaluation and 1% inflation: 0.5 mln USD / year  

These are really expensive platforms.

Inefficient yet very costly: we are spending 5 bln USD a year on BTC & ETH mining.

People talk about all these ICOs raising so much money.  Forget about ICOs. The real money goes into electricity and hardware just to perform 33 trxns/sec.

What it means is that we are spending 4-5 USD per trxn. They are some of the slowest, most expensive and limited transaction systems ever created in this planet.

BTS: theoretical max 100k/sec.

Steem, the most complex blockchain in existence today: conceived, designed, built, launched in just 6 months.

Others are building on platforms that will never allow them to get to market the way they need to in order to stay economically viable.

Larimer's track record: very fast & very powerful. (But very hard to gain popularity among developers.)

Steem & BitShares alone make up the majority of  industry network trxns per sec. And Ethereum is supposed to be a platform where many businesses operate.

If we tried to build Steem on Ethereum today we could not. It would cost us around 100 mln USD a year just to pay for the "likes".  It's not strong enough to handle complex DAOs.

We have all those exciting ideas but nothing is coming to market. All we have are just prototypes. What we are missing is an operating system. The developers are trying to build these amazing applications but they don't get to spend their time on building business logic. It's like trying to build Facebook with no Windows. Nothing is provided for them. Instead of spending their time on social engineering and business logic they are stuck on things like databases and inter-app communication. 

Despite all the hype very little proof of concept is happening because the technology just isn't there.

All existing smart-contract platforms are being built without any prior experience with building decentralized applications. How can I build a platform for decentralized applications if I've never built a decentralized application? 

Steem and BitShares - they are very different. One is a decentralized exchange and the other is social media. What they were able to do is look at them and figure out what's common between them.

The very bottom of EOS: asynchronous communication between smart-contracts.

On top of that: Databases, Account Permissions, Scheduling, Authentication, Inter-app Communication.

Two aims: reduce the time required to build a DAO and to make it as easy (or difficult depending on you perspective) as building a website.

EOS tokens are not consumable, you never have to spend them. It's not a pay-as-you-go model, it's an ownership model. If you own 1% of the tokens you own 1% of the network, including all it's resources: the bandwidth, the storage etc. And if you don't need that you can rent it out. It's just like owning a flat: you can use it or rent it out.

EOS is very cheap to run. So we can do something else with the funds coming from inflation. What EOS introduces is decentralized budgeting. Just imagine what we could do with those 5 bln USD a year if we didn't need it to buy electricity.
