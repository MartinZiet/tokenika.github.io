# PSD2 and Blockchain: Mutual Support

Under the new rules, banks will have to share client information with licensed third parties if the client asks it to do so.

PSD2 is different in that it is not upgrading current systems. It is creating new ones. Rather than figure out how to make processes more efficient, it wants to rethink how payments are made. And rather than tell market participants what the new system should look like, it wants them to figure it out for themselves. In opening up access to data, it aims to give them a powerful tool with which to do so.

Here's where blockchain-based services will most likely start to go mainstream: not in replacing current systems with better processes, but in forming part of new systems in a behind-the-scenes, non-threatening role.

# Banks Suggest Blockchain To Solve PSD2 Register Concerns

20TH OCT 2017 | WRITTEN BY: [FRAN WARBURTON](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/franwgamblingcompliancecom)

**An influential group of European banks has suggested distributed ledger technology could solve issues around third-party registers and consumer consent under the revised [Payment Services Directive (PSD2)](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal).**

Once PSD2 is in effect, account providers will be required to check whether a third party is fully authorised before granting access, [despite the lack](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/eba-central-register-%E2%80%98won%E2%80%99t-be-machine-readable%E2%80%99) of an EU-maintained machine-readable database of such firms.

In a [paper](https://www.abe-eba.eu/downloads/knowledge-and-research/EBA_Security_and_identity_challenges_in_cryptotechnologies_October_2017.pdf) on the security and identity challenges in cryptotechnologies, the Euro Banking Association suggested that a register based on a distributed ledger could provide an efficient, cost-effective and reliable way of overcoming that issue.

*Cryptotechnologies can enable enhanced consent management in two ways: by giving European banks an up-to-the-second, unified view of all authorised third-party providers in Europe and by giving end users control over which entities they have authorised to access their bank account information*, the association said.

*Each of these solutions addresses a different side of the same problem by ensuring that third-party access to bank account data is authorised and that end users retain control of their bank account data.*

The EU’s top financial regulator, the European Banking Authority (EBA), is developing a register of its own.

However, the authority has faced [criticism](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/psd2-regulator-defends-central-register-plan) for opting not to update that index in real-time or make it machine-readable, and in some cases industry groups have already [stepped in](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/industry-steps-work-psd2-registers) to fill the void.

The banking association paper added to those criticisms, highlighting a number of issues with the EBA’s proposal to have a single entity responsible for updating the register.

It doubted whether a sole register would be needed for all of Europe if authorization is coordinated between national regulators.

A distributed ledger technology (DLT) solution, on the other hand, would allow all national competent authorities to instantly update the ledger without the need for manual interventions, according to the association.

*With so many participants involved in updating, managing, and using the register, the use of DLT could enable greater speed and efficiency, with lower cost and a lower risk of unauthorized access to bank account information*, it said.

The ledger could include a record of a third-party provider’s authorization under PSD2 and be able to instantly notify members when an authorization has been retracted.

The association also suggested that DLT could provide *a comprehensive and well integrated* consent management system - a function that many financial institutions currently lack.

It argued that such systems would not only ease compliance with PSD2, but also help satisfy requirements of the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://paymentscompliance.com/regulation/general-data-protection-regulation), including provisions such as the *right to be forgotten*.

A consent system underpinned by DLT would provide a frictionless interface that helps control and manage data, it said, and give a fully auditable record of which entities have been given consumer consent to access bank account information.

*Permissioned ledgers help minimize scalability concerns, and occasional updates to the record of consent do not represent a high volume of transactions*, the paper said.

It refuted concerns about the immutability of data held on a ledger, contesting that the argument is *irrelevant* as the ledger would only store the record of consent rather than a customer’s private details.

However, practical challenges were recognized.

It would be difficult to determine where distributed ledger technologies would *fit in the IT stack*, the paper said, creating difficulty around business and data governance processes.

An analysis of the costs of segregating the data between ledgers would also be needed, and firms may face difficulty in developing a user-friendly and automated interface that allows customers to interact with the ledger.

Determining which entities are represented as nodes and the level of access they should be permitted was also recognized as a potential challenge.

# Euro Banking Association Issues Reports on Data Exploration Opportunities and Challenges in Cryptotechnologies

18TH OCT 2017 | WRITTEN BY: [PC RESEARCH](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/paymentscompliance-research-team)

On October 17, 2017, the Euro Banking Association(EBA) released two working group papers, *Data Exploration Opportunities in Corporate Banking: Key concepts and applications* and *Security and identity challenges in cryptotechnologies*, which include research from the multi-national membership of the EBA’s working groups on open banking and cryptotechnologies.

The EBA’s open banking group found that retail banking is a fast-moving environment with digital (transactional) experiences across channels and customer behaviour, and changing expectations mean that banks need to add correctives to the business models. A number of banks are experimenting with data driven services to provide personalised financial services to their customers.

Accessibility of data in corporate banking is growing due to the regulatory introduction of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is recommended that banks develop capabilities in three areas:
* Identifying relevant data sources.
* Unlocking internal and external data sources (the latter of which will become more accessible under PSD2).
* Converting data into actionable information.

The security report focuses on how cryptotechnologies can be improved and maintained on data security and provide new possibilities for financial institutions, as financial institutions could benefit from regulatory and compliance perspectives, as well as lower costs in providing services once cryptotechnologies are adopted. They also have the potential to improve speed of the settlement process, accessibility and operability. Regulators and financial institutions are actively studying cryptotechnologies across the world. Banks are aiming to determine how cryptotechnologies interact with legacy systems and how distributed ledger technology (DLT) fits in an institution’s technology stack. The adoption of their use can be within a single organisation, an entire payments community, cross-domain, or even across borders.

The paper examines two use cases:
* Third-party authorisation, as well as know your customer (KYC) and due diligence processes.
* To explore how cryptotechnologies could enhance existing IT and business processes while providing the flexibility for future needs.

*To meet customer expectations and regulatory requirements around data control and sharing, banks are working on solutions that provide faster information exchange and greater transparency. We think that the use of cryptotechnologies can make a difference when it comes to developing such solutions. As permissioned and private ledger solutions have continued to evolve, financial industry players now have tools at their disposal allowing them to develop financial services that unlock the transparency, speed and efficiency of distributed ledgers to their customers while fully ensuring or even enhancing data security and integrity*, said José Vicente, deputy manager (Payments and External Entities Unit) at Banco Comercial Português, and chair of the EBA’s cryptotechnologies working group.

# European Commission Adopts PSD2 Technical Standards

27TH NOV 2017 | WRITTEN BY: [JOHN BASQUILL](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/johnbpaymentscompliancecom)

**The European Commission has formally submitted its eagerly anticipated regulatory technical standards on payment security for approval by the European Parliament and Council.**

The standards have [long proven controversial](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/fintechs-hit-back-fido-screen-scraping-claims), both for introducing tough requirements around authenticating online payments and for creating a framework that ensures third-party account access is sufficiently secure without stifling fintechs’ business models.

If approved, the standards will sit alongside the revised [Payment Services Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal) (PSD2) across Europe, with EU officials anticipating they will take effect around September 2019.

“These new rules will guide all market players, old and new, to offer better payment services to consumers while ensuring their security,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the commission’s vice president for financial services.

The commission published the [final text](http://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/level-2-measures/psd2-rts-2017-7782_en.pdf) at midday, Central European Time.

One of the most closely watched aspects of the standards has been whether third-party providers will be allowed to gain account access via the consumer’s online banking interface — known as screen scraping — or whether they will be forced to use an interface provided by the bank.

As [reported](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-settles-psd2-technical-standards) by PaymentsCompliance in October, the final commission text has suggested a compromise.

If a bank builds a well-functioning dedicated interface and makes it available for three months’ market testing, national regulators can grant that interface a seal of approval.

That would mean any authorised third party would have to use that interface in order to provide payment initiation or account information services.

According to today’s final text, that exemption would only be granted if the dedicated interface “been widely used for at least three months by payment service providers to offer account information services, payment initiation services and to provide confirmation on the availability of funds for card- based payments”.

However, if a bank’s interface is not approved and it suffers a technical outage, third parties can use the consumer interface as a “fallback” option — providing they identify themselves to the bank involved.

“Unplanned unavailability or a systems breakdown may be presumed to have arisen when five consecutive requests for access to information for the provision of payment initiation services or account information services are not replied to within 30 seconds,” the text states.

Banks will have to communicate details of their contingency plan to any payment service provider attempting to gain access, and to the national regulator.

A bank that has been granted an exemption can have it revoked by the regulator after two weeks if unforeseen problems arise and are not resolved.

The European Commission said it hopes that final arrangement will strike a balance between the two contrasting arguments set out by banks and fintechs.

Third parties accused banks of deliberately developing dedicated interfaces that would restrict their activities, while banks said screen scraping represents a major risk to consumers’ data security.

The commission has made few changes to the provisions on strong authentication.

A system of exemptions based on fraud rates has been retained, despite [questions](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/legal-view-psd2-and-strong-authentication) over how it will work in practice.

An exemption for certain business-to-business payments that involve “dedicated payment processes or protocols that are only made available to payers who are not consumers” has been added — a provision that will be welcomed by the online travel retail sector.

The ability for payers to “whitelist” certain payees has also been unchanged, despite calls for clarity over whether that can be used to cover card transactions as well as credit transfers.

The European Parliament and Council now have three months — which can be extended to six — to decide whether to approve or reject the standards.

Although a rejection would be disastrous for the commission, officials [reiterated](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/commission-confident-lawmakers-will-approve-psd2-standards) they are confident the standards will pass as they have “worked closely” with the other two legislative bodies during the redrafting process.

# PSD2: Questions Resurface Over Credential Sharing

9TH FEB 2018 | WRITTEN BY: [JOHN BASQUILL](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/johnbpaymentscompliancecom) & [FRAN WARBURTON](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/franwgamblingcompliancecom)

**Banks and fintechs remain at odds over whether consumers will be able to share their online banking login credentials with third parties under incoming EU-wide security standards.**

Several projects currently underway in Europe to develop application programming interfaces (APIs) for third-party access have used a “redirect” model for carrying out customer authentication.

That means a consumer wishing to use a payment initiation service when shopping online, for example, would be forwarded onto a login screen operated by their bank rather than share their login details with the third party.

However, after [complaints](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/%E2%80%98authentication-redirection%E2%80%99-proves-problematic-under-psd2) that would result in a clumsy and fragmented checkout process, the European Commission made reference to the practice in changes to regulatory technical standards that will accompany the revised [Payment Services Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal) (PSD2).

It said that banks [would not be allowed](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-takes-tough-line-psd2-%E2%80%98redirection%E2%80%99) to obstruct third parties’ business models, [giving the example](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-adopts-psd2-technical-standards) of “imposing redirection” as a practice that may result in a bank’s API not gaining the approval of its national regulator.

Speaking in a personal capacity at an industry event last week, European Commission unit head Ralf Jacob reiterated that message.

“If, for instance, there was a redirection to a page that was not properly formatted or would not really fit into the customer journey as designed by the third-party provider, there would be a problem and we would not like to see that,” he said.

However, Jacob said that some industry participants or national regulators, particularly in Nordic countries, were alarmed as they “interpreted that as a prohibition on redirection”.

There are two widely used alternatives to the redirect currently on the market; both are variants of the “pass through” model, which involves a third party transmitting authentication details to the bank.

The first alternative — an embedded pass-through — has long been used by existing payment initiation services, which collect a user’s login details and transmit them to the account-holding bank.

A decoupled pass-through, however, involves parallel authentication by the bank and the third party, without the customer journey being taken out of the third party’s hands.

That arrangement can be used in arrangements where there is an external authentication system, such as a national ID database.

In situations where a decoupled pass-through is not feasible, third parties are calling for the embedded pass-through to be made available.

“Customer authentication via redirection to [banks’] websites would be a conversion killer,” said Ralf Ohlhausen, a director at fintech firm PPRO and member of the Euro Retail Payments Board's (ERPB) working group on payment initiation.

“That would deprive third-party providers from offering their own end-to-end service via mobile app, and it would really only work for e-commerce.”

Ohlhausen suggested that if the commission did not trust payment initiation service providers to handle users’ online banking login credentials safely, it would have explicitly prohibited credential sharing in the level one text.

Existing interbank payment services that use a redirect model, such as iDEAL in the Netherlands, are not considered third parties under PSD2, he added.

Gijs Boudewijn, chairman of the European Banking Federation’s Payments System Committee, admitted there “is a lot of confusion” around the legality of credential sharing.

“Our understanding is that [banks] can mandate the current strong customer authentication methods through a redirect, but it must be well implemented in the API and provide for a good customer journey,” he explained.

“Otherwise it might create an ‘obstacle’, which might be a reason for national competent authorities not to grant an [exemption for the fallback mechanism](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/eba-takes-technical-standards-battle-commission).

“That is the incentive for [banks] to provide good APIs, which I believe will be one of the issues we will have to address in the new API evaluation group.”

The evaluation group met for the first time last week, with the commission [hoping](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/psd2-commission-pins-hopes-new-api-working-group) it will be able to develop access mechanisms that are satisfactory both to banks and third-party providers.

According to a [report](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/retpaym/shared/pdf/8th-ERPB-meeting/PIS_working_group_report.pdf?483e4d28242cd84322850a01e549d116) by the ERPB payment initiation working group published in November last year, the national APIs under development in the UK, Poland and Slovakia are all built around a redirect model.

France’s STET project uses a pass-through, while the Berlin Group API can support a redirect model or either pass-through option.

# Mixed Reviews For Leaked EU Fintech Plan

15TH FEB 2018 | WRITTEN BY: [DOUGLAS CLARKE-WILLIAMS](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/douglascpaymentscompliancecom)

**A draft action plan for fintech recently leaked from the European Commission has raised concerns about the pace and feasibility of the accelerating drive for regulatory alignment.**

Diagnosing the uneven adoption of different aspects of fintechs between member states as a result of too much variance in national regulatory regimes, the [action plan](http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Draft-FinTech-Action-Plan.pdf) highlights recent activities by the commission to ease the operation of fintechs between jurisdictions.

It follows a [consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/finance-consultations-2017-fintech_en) on fintech in the EU, which ran between March and June last year.

The paper suggested the use of “targeted initiatives” to encourage fintech adoption rather than large-scale legislative or regulatory actions, with a particular focus on those aspects where variation between jurisdictions was greatest.

This included licensing, the use of cloud services and blockchain, and cybersecurity concerns.

The paper’s aims “would entail lowering barriers that innovative models may face, supporting the uptake of new technologies and creating a vibrant borderless environment for fintech while ensuring that potential risks are adequately monitored and mitigated”.

Some commenters expressed concern over just how these ideals could work in practice, particularly considering the ongoing struggle to bring all member states up to the same level for even those major initiatives, such as the [4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/4th-amld-portal) (4th AMLD), the deadline for which has long passed.

Simon Deane-Johns, a consultant solicitor at Keystone Law, held issue with the commission's ambitions when it came to licensing.

“It troubles me slightly as to what the purpose of that is,” he said to PaymentsCompliance.

The crux of the matter in this case lays in whether the commission is planning to prune national regulation which, for example, leads to crowdfunding initiatives falling under the definition of banking activities and being, therefore, inhospitable to smaller innovative companies.

But Deane-Johns remained sceptical of the possibility of targeted EU action having a comprehensive effect on local fintech growth.

“To the extent that it does remove regulatory obstacles in some markets, that might be helpful in those markets in encouraging innovation [but] that’s an incredibly localised assessment to make,” he said.

“If your expectation is to kickstart markets with regulation I think it’s incredibly rare to see that happen.”

The draft action plan drew attention to the fact that there is currently no EU-level regulation on crowdfunding, and noted that many respondents to the consultation had said that the variance in regulation among those 11 member states who had addressed the issue made scaling up across the continent difficult.

However, Jacqui Hatfield, head of the financial services regulatory team in London at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, said that this was, if anything, an overdue issue for Europe to be dealing with.

“We shouldn’t be in a situation now where crowdfunding is dealt with in different ways in different member states,” she said

“Harmonisation is required to prevent potential liability issues and to enable effective passporting.”

The commission also observed that this situation is pertinent to those in the virtual currency sector, where there is likewise little in the way of overarching EU guidance.

“Further efforts are needed to identify existing diverging licensing requirements affecting fintech firms,” the plan said.

“Follow-up action could include: clarifying the applicable EU legislative framework for services; assessing the need for an EU framework to cover new innovative business models; and providing guidance to national supervisors to ensure more convergence between national regulatory regimes.”

Hatfield welcomed the plan’s emphasis on cybersecurity, citing examples where a lack of attention to public confidence in security has poured cold water on industry’s efforts to reform — most notably the revised [Payment Services Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal)(PSD2) and open banking initiatives.  

For industry representatives in the UK, however, the commission’s draft  was simply another thread in the rich tapestry of Brexit regulatory concerns.

“The main point, unfortunately here, is Brexit: how/whether, given Brexit, the UK’s financial services sector can remain an integral part of the digitalisation of financial services and how it develops both at EU-level and world-wide,” said Ruth Milligan, head of the financial services and payments programme at techUK.

She pointed to a mention in the plan of fresh EU regulation on data flows in relation to cloud services, even as the UK dawdles over its future commitment to the existing [General Data Protection Regulation](https://paymentscompliance.com/gdpr-portal) (GDPR) standard.

Ironically, many of the proposals in this plan, such as the idea for a network of sandboxes across member states, originated in the UK.

“In a lot of cases they, on a European level, are going to be following what we’re already doing in the UK,” Hatfield observed.

# PSD2: ECB Joins Calls For Early Adoption Of Technical Standards

16TH FEB 2018 | WRITTEN BY: [FRAN WARBURTON](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/franwgamblingcompliancecom)

**A European Central Bank (ECB) official has called on payments firms to speed up implementation of security rules that accompany the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) to unlock the potential of instant payments.**

Yves Mersch, a member of the executive board of the ECB, said that it was in the industry’s own interests to comply with the delayed regulatory technical standards on strong customer [authentication](https://paymentscompliance.com/glossary#Authentication) before they are expected to take effect in September 2019.

Doing so would “guarantee the high security levels that are necessary to retain public trust in the payment system and payment services”, he said.

Mersch’s comments, which were made at an event in Paris on Thursday, echoed calls from the [European Banking Authority (EBA)](https://paymentscompliance.com/glossary#European_Banking_Authority_EBA) for member states to encourage entities to make the necessary policy changes and system updates as soon as possible.

However, there are still [several areas of the standards that demand further clarity](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/legal-view-psd2-and-strong-authentication), including the strong authentication requirements for cumulative [contactless](https://paymentscompliance.com/glossary#Contactless) payments and exemptions for low fraud rates and “whitelisted” or trusted beneficiaries.

To ensure continued applicability of stringent security standards, the EBA recommended that part of the PSD1 security guidelines should continue to apply beyond the PSD2 application date until they are superseded by the strong customer authentication rules.

According to the ECB official, early adoption of the enhanced security standards will be crucial to the development of emerging instant payment solutions, although there is no legal obligation to do so.

Infrastructure enabling instant payments is maturing quickly across the globe. In Europe, the industry-led SCT Inst scheme, which went live in November 2017, now has more than 1,000 payment service providers signed up from 12 countries.

The ECB is working on its own Target Instant Payments [Settlement](https://paymentscompliance.com/glossary#Settlement) (TIPS) project, which will enable all transactions to be settled within ten seconds after operations commence in November next year — a development which Mersch has [championed](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/ecb-dashes-hopes-virtual-currency-mainstream-payment-system) over alternative blockchain payments mechanisms.

Although the central banker commended the “great progress” made in instant payments, he questioned why, with the infrastructure already in place, applications have so far been limited to peer-to-peer transfers.

> “Now it is time to go one step further and provide efficient and innovative end-user solutions that allow consumers and businesses across Europe to make instant payments in any payment situation, especially at the point of sale, where the majority of retail payments are made,” said Yves Mersch of the European Central Bank.  

The benefits of instant payments for e-commerce are such that improved cash flow will allow merchants to use funds received immediately to pay outgoings, such as their suppliers.

Mersch urged industry to develop pan-EU point of sale solutions that credit the merchant’s account with finality — like cash — instead of providing a claim against the customer or guarantee from a credit card company.

“I call on the industry to take the next step and develop end-user solutions that will allow consumers and businesses to enjoy the benefits of instant electronic payments in any payment situation, in addition to cash, which is still popular,” he said.

In a separate speech earlier this week, the ECB official also ran to the defence of cash.

Although the general direction of the industry and policymakers alike appears to encourage a switch to digital, with some even [declaring](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/financial-giants-accused-fuelling-decline-free-use-atms) a “war on cash”, Mersch vowed to protect the status of euro banknotes as legal tender.

He claimed that there has yet to be a viable alternative that facilitates freedom, allows equality and participation, in addition to providing privacy, security and protection for consumers.

# ECB Dashes Hopes Of Virtual Currency As Mainstream Payment System

9TH FEB 2018 | WRITTEN BY: [DOUGLAS CLARKE-WILLIAMS](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/douglascpaymentscompliancecom)

**A senior European Central Bank (ECB) official has poured cold water on fintechs’ hopes that virtual currency will go mainstream on the continent in the near future. **

Yves Mersch, a member of the ECB’s executive board, gave a wide-ranging speech on Thursday in London in which he raised numerous concerns over the possibility of central banks incorporating virtual currency or digital base currency (DBM) into the mainstream financial system.

He spoke particularly in the context of virtual currency as a replacement for cash, since in its anonymity and decentralised method of exchange it holds many of the traits that appeal about cash.

“It is important to avoid being beguiled by the flashing lights of novelty and assuming that, just because a technology is new, it is also better,” Mersch said.

“Virtual currencies are not money, nor will they be in the foreseeable future.”

He first suggested one argument — that replacing cash with central bank-issued digital currency would reduce crime — did not hold up under closer observation and may even prove to be counter-intuitive.

“There is no material evidence that abolishing cash will inhibit crime,” he said. “Electronic storage and transfer may well prove easier for criminal than banknotes.”

Mersch also noted that with 79 percent of all point of sale payments in the eurozone being made with cash, there was little indication of a clamouring for a cashless society among the public.

He then dismissed suggestions that the introduction of central bank-backed virtual currency would benefit monetary policy by removing the floor on interest rates, and raised the concern that the attraction of a risk-free central virtual currency during another banking crisis could cause a run on deposits and exacerbate the situation.

Mersch echoed the opinion of many other regulators on the technology’s regulatory position.

He said virtual currencies are, in their current form, inherently speculative rather than stores of value, and consumers should be warned of the risks of investing.

He also noted that the nature of virtual currencies makes them impossible to prohibit fully. 

“It is clear that VCs [virtual currencies] cannot be directly or overseen in the absence of a centralised governance and legal framework,” he said.

“Recognising their limits here, most countries tolerate the usage of VCs without trying to ban them.”

Mersch’s analysis was supported by Agustín Carstens, general manager at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), who voiced similar opinions in a speech earlier this week.

Carstens, however, gave a more forceful exhortation not to allow virtual currencies to sidestep the precautions in place for other payment mechanisms.

Like Mersch, he observed that virtual currencies failed to clear the hurdle to be considered actual currency thanks to their essentially unsupported and speculative nature.

As such, he said that central banks’ foremost concern should be to ensure that cryptocurrencies should not receive special treatment simply because of  their novel structure.

“Authorities should apply the principles that the Basel Process has adhered to for years: to provide a level playing field to all participants in financial markets — banks and non-banks alike — while at the same time fostering innovative, secure and competitive markets,” he said.

“In this context, this means, among other things, ensuring that the same high standards that money transfer and payment service providers have to meet are also met by Bitcoin-type exchanges.”

Similar concerns have been [raised](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/us-authorities-eye-closer-cooperation-virtual-currencies) this week in the United States, where the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on the measures being undertaken by federal agencies to keep virtual currencies in check.
Mersch highlighted these stateside concerns in his speech and pointed to the work of the Securities and Exchange Commission in warning investors in Bitcoin of the difficulties and potential dangers they face.

Although the idea of a central bank digital currency has failed to gain widespread traction, some countries, including Tunisia, Senegal and Venezuela, have examined creating centrally backed digital currencies.

Lithuania also recently [announced](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/central-bank-blockchain-captures-lithuanian-regulator%E2%80%99s) plans to launch a central bank blockchain in the near future, for the purposes of supporting industry experimentation and innovation.
Speaking to reporters following Thursday's speech, Mersch confirmed that the issue of central bank virtual currencies would be addressed at the G20 meeting in March.

# Central Bank Blockchain Captures Lithuanian Regulator’s Imagination

12TH JAN 2018 | WRITTEN BY: [JOHN BASQUILL](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/johnbpaymentscompliancecom)

**Lithuania’s trailblazing financial regulator will invite technologists to construct a central bank blockchain, letting budding innovators experiment with the technology by developing new overlay services.**

The Bank of Lithuania, a self-described “super-regulator” that oversees the country’s entire banking and payments sector, announced this week that the project could be launched as early as next year.

The initiative, dubbed LBChain, remains in its early stages, but is envisaged as a testing ground for firms seeking to make use of the technology that underpins virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

“We hope all kind of businesses working in the financial services field or building products for financial services could benefit from LBChain,” said Marius Jurgilas, board member at the central bank.

Jurgilas told PaymentsCompliance that the authority had not yet decided on the precise technological specifications to which the ledger will be subject.

Options include a fully public, decentralised ledger akin to the Bitcoin blockchain, or a private ledger where participants are vetted and selected by a central overseer.

“As we are planning to develop LBChain through the EU pre-commercial procurement process, the Bank of Lithuania will be partnering with commercial companies to develop the platform,” he explained.

> “We have already contacted some of the potential companies to understand the cost of their participation,” said Marius Jurgilas, Bank of Lithuania.

The Bank of Lithuania said it made the decision due to the technology’s “tremendous adaptation potential for innovations”, citing potential use cases in the financial and public sectors.

It cited financial operations and electronic voting as functions that involve a high level of data transmission, but that also require an impeccable level of security and credibility.

The initiative marks the latest in a series of regulatory reforms aimed at facilitating competition from non-bank financial firms.

Lithuania has already introduced a [specialised regime](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/interview-lithuania-paves-way-non-bank-innovators) for firms wishing to settle transactions in central bank funds without a full banking licence, and in November [joined the European SCT Inst scheme](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/interview-lithuania-paves-way-non-bank-innovators) for real-time payment processing in euro.

Although ultimately a central bank initiative, the LBChain project was in part influenced by interest from companies that could become involved at a later stage.

“The Bank of Lithuania would provide LBChain participants a technical platform and consultations on applicable regulations,” it explained.

“It is planned that this platform’s facilities will only be available to innovative companies selected according to certain criteria that devise and develop blockchain technology based services and solutions.”

If EU co-funding is secured quickly, the bank hopes to have the project up and running in 2019.

One potential model for LBChain could be to mimic the ledger created by Ethereum, but with restrictions on who can use it as the basis for building new services.

Since its launch in 2015, far more providers have turned to Ethereum than Bitcoin as the building blocks for decentralised products and services.

Most famously, the bulk of initial coin offerings (ICOs) have made use of Ethereum’s blockchain, developing sidechains on which their own virtual currencies can operate.

However, the ledger has also been used to create self-executing smart contracts, and gained notoriety last month when it emerged that a lucrative virtual pet game had driven a six-fold increase in pending transactions.

The Bank of Lithuania joins a small number of other financial regulators in setting out a legal framework aimed at encouraging blockchain-based innovation.

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has so far [granted places](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/news_analysis/fca-throws-weight-behind-blockchain-payments) in its regulatory sandbox — a legal “safe space” for testing new products — to several payment providers looking to make use of the technology.

Gibraltar’s forward-looking authority has [already imposed](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/blockchain-firms-eye-gibraltar-ahead-legal-reforms-says-regulator) a principles-based regulatory framework on blockchain firms, providing they are not already subject to any pre-existing regulatory regime.

Singapore’s regulator has said it [hopes](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/singapore-eyes-blockchain-cross-border-payments-system) the technology will be adopted as the new infrastructure for cross-border payments, while officials in [Russia](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/russia-formalises-virtual-currency-regulation-plan) and [Venezuela](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/venezuela-state-virtual-currency-%E2%80%98-pipe-dream%E2%80%99-say-experts) have reportedly toyed with launching national cryptocurrencies as a work-around to obstructive international sanctions regimes.

# Lithuania: Central Bank to Launch Sandbox Platform for Blockchain

10TH JAN 2018 | WRITTEN BY: [PC RESEARCH](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/paymentscompliance-research-team)

On January 9, 2018 the Bank of Lithuania published an announcement that it is to create an ecosystem for domestic and foreign companies to develop and test fintech innovations, to be known as LBChain.

LBChain is expected to help companies expand knowledge in fintech, undertake blockchain research and test innovative products before introducing them to the market. The central bank would also support innovative firms on regulatory aspects and provide technical platform.

The bank is planning to introduce a LBChain platform/service in 2019 once co-financing with EU funds and necessary preparations are undertaken.

*"This platform will contribute to the creation of better conditions in Lithuania for the development of the FinTech business and innovation-friendly regulation, as well as help the Bank of Lithuania keep pace with technology innovations that change financial institution activities,"* said Marius Jurgilas, a member of the board of the Bank of Lithuania.

*"Blockchain technology has a tremendous adaptation potential for innovations conducive to consumers in both the financial and public sectors. Giving room to regulated development of this technology would provide our country with particularly favourable opportunities for investment and attraction of talents as well as acceleration of advanced innovations."*
