### PSD2 and Blockchain: Mutual Support

Under the new rules, banks will have to share client information with licensed third parties if the client asks it to do so.

PSD2 is different in that it is not upgrading current systems. It is creating new ones. Rather than figure out how to make processes more efficient, it wants to rethink how payments are made. And rather than tell market participants what the new system should look like, it wants them to figure it out for themselves. In opening up access to data, it aims to give them a powerful tool with which to do so.

Here's where blockchain-based services will most likely start to go mainstream: not in replacing current systems with better processes, but in forming part of new systems in a behind-the-scenes, non-threatening role.

### Banks Suggest Blockchain To Solve PSD2 Register Concerns

An influential group of European banks has suggested distributed ledger technology could solve issues around third-party registers and consumer consent under the revised [Payment Services Directive (PSD2)](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal).

Once PSD2 is in effect, account providers will be required to check whether a third party is fully authorised before granting access, [despite the lack](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/eba-central-register-%E2%80%98won%E2%80%99t-be-machine-readable%E2%80%99) of an EU-maintained machine-readable database of such firms.

In a [paper](https://www.abe-eba.eu/downloads/knowledge-and-research/EBA_Security_and_identity_challenges_in_cryptotechnologies_October_2017.pdf) on the security and identity challenges in cryptotechnologies, the Euro Banking Association suggested that a register based on a distributed ledger could provide an efficient, cost-effective and reliable way of overcoming that issue.

*Cryptotechnologies can enable enhanced consent management in two ways: by giving European banks an up-to-the-second, unified view of all authorised third-party providers in Europe and by giving end users control over which entities they have authorised to access their bank account information*, the association said.

*Each of these solutions addresses a different side of the same problem by ensuring that third-party access to bank account data is authorised and that end users retain control of their bank account data.*

The EU’s top financial regulator, the European Banking Authority (EBA), is developing a register of its own.

However, the authority has faced [criticism](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/psd2-regulator-defends-central-register-plan) for opting not to update that index in real-time or make it machine-readable, and in some cases industry groups have already [stepped in](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/industry-steps-work-psd2-registers) to fill the void.

The banking association paper added to those criticisms, highlighting a number of issues with the EBA’s proposal to have a single entity responsible for updating the register.

It doubted whether a sole register would be needed for all of Europe if authorization is coordinated between national regulators.

A distributed ledger technology (DLT) solution, on the other hand, would allow all national competent authorities to instantly update the ledger without the need for manual interventions, according to the association.

*With so many participants involved in updating, managing, and using the register, the use of DLT could enable greater speed and efficiency, with lower cost and a lower risk of unauthorized access to bank account information*, it said.

The ledger could include a record of a third-party provider’s authorization under PSD2 and be able to instantly notify members when an authorization has been retracted.

The association also suggested that DLT could provide *a comprehensive and well integrated* consent management system - a function that many financial institutions currently lack.

It argued that such systems would not only ease compliance with PSD2, but also help satisfy requirements of the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://paymentscompliance.com/regulation/general-data-protection-regulation), including provisions such as the *right to be forgotten*.

A consent system underpinned by DLT would provide a frictionless interface that helps control and manage data, it said, and give a fully auditable record of which entities have been given consumer consent to access bank account information.

*Permissioned ledgers help minimize scalability concerns, and occasional updates to the record of consent do not represent a high volume of transactions*, the paper said.

It refuted concerns about the immutability of data held on a ledger, contesting that the argument is *irrelevant* as the ledger would only store the record of consent rather than a customer’s private details.

However, practical challenges were recognized.

It would be difficult to determine where distributed ledger technologies would *fit in the IT stack*, the paper said, creating difficulty around business and data governance processes.

An analysis of the costs of segregating the data between ledgers would also be needed, and firms may face difficulty in developing a user-friendly and automated interface that allows customers to interact with the ledger.

Determining which entities are represented as nodes and the level of access they should be permitted was also recognized as a potential challenge.

### Euro Banking Association Issues Reports on Data Exploration Opportunities and Challenges in Cryptotechnologies

On October 17, 2017, the Euro Banking Association(EBA) released two working group papers, *Data Exploration Opportunities in Corporate Banking: Key concepts and applications* and *Security and identity challenges in cryptotechnologies*, which include research from the multi-national membership of the EBA’s working groups on open banking and cryptotechnologies.

The EBA’s open banking group found that retail banking is a fast-moving environment with digital (transactional) experiences across channels and customer behaviour, and changing expectations mean that banks need to add correctives to the business models. A number of banks are experimenting with data driven services to provide personalised financial services to their customers.

Accessibility of data in corporate banking is growing due to the regulatory introduction of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is recommended that banks develop capabilities in three areas:
* Identifying relevant data sources.
* Unlocking internal and external data sources (the latter of which will become more accessible under PSD2).
* Converting data into actionable information.

The security report focuses on how cryptotechnologies can be improved and maintained on data security and provide new possibilities for financial institutions, as financial institutions could benefit from regulatory and compliance perspectives, as well as lower costs in providing services once cryptotechnologies are adopted. They also have the potential to improve speed of the settlement process, accessibility and operability. Regulators and financial institutions are actively studying cryptotechnologies across the world. Banks are aiming to determine how cryptotechnologies interact with legacy systems and how distributed ledger technology (DLT) fits in an institution’s technology stack. The adoption of their use can be within a single organisation, an entire payments community, cross-domain, or even across borders.

The paper examines two use cases:
* Third-party authorisation, as well as know your customer (KYC) and due diligence processes.
* To explore how cryptotechnologies could enhance existing IT and business processes while providing the flexibility for future needs.

*To meet customer expectations and regulatory requirements around data control and sharing, banks are working on solutions that provide faster information exchange and greater transparency. We think that the use of cryptotechnologies can make a difference when it comes to developing such solutions. As permissioned and private ledger solutions have continued to evolve, financial industry players now have tools at their disposal allowing them to develop financial services that unlock the transparency, speed and efficiency of distributed ledgers to their customers while fully ensuring or even enhancing data security and integrity*, said José Vicente, deputy manager (Payments and External Entities Unit) at Banco Comercial Português, and chair of the EBA’s cryptotechnologies working group.
