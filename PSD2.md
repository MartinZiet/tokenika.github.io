### PSD2 and Blockchain: Mutual Support

Under the new rules, banks will have to share client information with licensed third parties if the client asks it to do so.

PSD2 is different in that it is not upgrading current systems. It is creating new ones. Rather than figure out how to make processes more efficient, it wants to rethink how payments are made. And rather than tell market participants what the new system should look like, it wants them to figure it out for themselves. In opening up access to data, it aims to give them a powerful tool with which to do so.

Here's where blockchain-based services will most likely start to go mainstream: not in replacing current systems with better processes, but in forming part of new systems in a behind-the-scenes, non-threatening role.

### Banks Suggest Blockchain To Solve PSD2 Register Concerns

20TH OCT 2017 | WRITTEN BY: [FRAN WARBURTON](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/franwgamblingcompliancecom)

**An influential group of European banks has suggested distributed ledger technology could solve issues around third-party registers and consumer consent under the revised [Payment Services Directive (PSD2)](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal).**

Once PSD2 is in effect, account providers will be required to check whether a third party is fully authorised before granting access, [despite the lack](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/eba-central-register-%E2%80%98won%E2%80%99t-be-machine-readable%E2%80%99) of an EU-maintained machine-readable database of such firms.

In a [paper](https://www.abe-eba.eu/downloads/knowledge-and-research/EBA_Security_and_identity_challenges_in_cryptotechnologies_October_2017.pdf) on the security and identity challenges in cryptotechnologies, the Euro Banking Association suggested that a register based on a distributed ledger could provide an efficient, cost-effective and reliable way of overcoming that issue.

*Cryptotechnologies can enable enhanced consent management in two ways: by giving European banks an up-to-the-second, unified view of all authorised third-party providers in Europe and by giving end users control over which entities they have authorised to access their bank account information*, the association said.

*Each of these solutions addresses a different side of the same problem by ensuring that third-party access to bank account data is authorised and that end users retain control of their bank account data.*

The EU’s top financial regulator, the European Banking Authority (EBA), is developing a register of its own.

However, the authority has faced [criticism](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/psd2-regulator-defends-central-register-plan) for opting not to update that index in real-time or make it machine-readable, and in some cases industry groups have already [stepped in](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/industry-steps-work-psd2-registers) to fill the void.

The banking association paper added to those criticisms, highlighting a number of issues with the EBA’s proposal to have a single entity responsible for updating the register.

It doubted whether a sole register would be needed for all of Europe if authorization is coordinated between national regulators.

A distributed ledger technology (DLT) solution, on the other hand, would allow all national competent authorities to instantly update the ledger without the need for manual interventions, according to the association.

*With so many participants involved in updating, managing, and using the register, the use of DLT could enable greater speed and efficiency, with lower cost and a lower risk of unauthorized access to bank account information*, it said.

The ledger could include a record of a third-party provider’s authorization under PSD2 and be able to instantly notify members when an authorization has been retracted.

The association also suggested that DLT could provide *a comprehensive and well integrated* consent management system - a function that many financial institutions currently lack.

It argued that such systems would not only ease compliance with PSD2, but also help satisfy requirements of the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://paymentscompliance.com/regulation/general-data-protection-regulation), including provisions such as the *right to be forgotten*.

A consent system underpinned by DLT would provide a frictionless interface that helps control and manage data, it said, and give a fully auditable record of which entities have been given consumer consent to access bank account information.

*Permissioned ledgers help minimize scalability concerns, and occasional updates to the record of consent do not represent a high volume of transactions*, the paper said.

It refuted concerns about the immutability of data held on a ledger, contesting that the argument is *irrelevant* as the ledger would only store the record of consent rather than a customer’s private details.

However, practical challenges were recognized.

It would be difficult to determine where distributed ledger technologies would *fit in the IT stack*, the paper said, creating difficulty around business and data governance processes.

An analysis of the costs of segregating the data between ledgers would also be needed, and firms may face difficulty in developing a user-friendly and automated interface that allows customers to interact with the ledger.

Determining which entities are represented as nodes and the level of access they should be permitted was also recognized as a potential challenge.

### Euro Banking Association Issues Reports on Data Exploration Opportunities and Challenges in Cryptotechnologies

18TH OCT 2017 | WRITTEN BY: [PC RESEARCH](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/paymentscompliance-research-team)

On October 17, 2017, the Euro Banking Association(EBA) released two working group papers, *Data Exploration Opportunities in Corporate Banking: Key concepts and applications* and *Security and identity challenges in cryptotechnologies*, which include research from the multi-national membership of the EBA’s working groups on open banking and cryptotechnologies.

The EBA’s open banking group found that retail banking is a fast-moving environment with digital (transactional) experiences across channels and customer behaviour, and changing expectations mean that banks need to add correctives to the business models. A number of banks are experimenting with data driven services to provide personalised financial services to their customers.

Accessibility of data in corporate banking is growing due to the regulatory introduction of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is recommended that banks develop capabilities in three areas:
* Identifying relevant data sources.
* Unlocking internal and external data sources (the latter of which will become more accessible under PSD2).
* Converting data into actionable information.

The security report focuses on how cryptotechnologies can be improved and maintained on data security and provide new possibilities for financial institutions, as financial institutions could benefit from regulatory and compliance perspectives, as well as lower costs in providing services once cryptotechnologies are adopted. They also have the potential to improve speed of the settlement process, accessibility and operability. Regulators and financial institutions are actively studying cryptotechnologies across the world. Banks are aiming to determine how cryptotechnologies interact with legacy systems and how distributed ledger technology (DLT) fits in an institution’s technology stack. The adoption of their use can be within a single organisation, an entire payments community, cross-domain, or even across borders.

The paper examines two use cases:
* Third-party authorisation, as well as know your customer (KYC) and due diligence processes.
* To explore how cryptotechnologies could enhance existing IT and business processes while providing the flexibility for future needs.

*To meet customer expectations and regulatory requirements around data control and sharing, banks are working on solutions that provide faster information exchange and greater transparency. We think that the use of cryptotechnologies can make a difference when it comes to developing such solutions. As permissioned and private ledger solutions have continued to evolve, financial industry players now have tools at their disposal allowing them to develop financial services that unlock the transparency, speed and efficiency of distributed ledgers to their customers while fully ensuring or even enhancing data security and integrity*, said José Vicente, deputy manager (Payments and External Entities Unit) at Banco Comercial Português, and chair of the EBA’s cryptotechnologies working group.

### European Commission Adopts PSD2 Technical Standards

27TH NOV 2017 | WRITTEN BY: [JOHN BASQUILL](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/johnbpaymentscompliancecom)

**The European Commission has formally submitted its eagerly anticipated regulatory technical standards on payment security for approval by the European Parliament and Council.**

The standards have [long proven controversial](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/fintechs-hit-back-fido-screen-scraping-claims), both for introducing tough requirements around authenticating online payments and for creating a framework that ensures third-party account access is sufficiently secure without stifling fintechs’ business models.

If approved, the standards will sit alongside the revised [Payment Services Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal) (PSD2) across Europe, with EU officials anticipating they will take effect around September 2019.

“These new rules will guide all market players, old and new, to offer better payment services to consumers while ensuring their security,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the commission’s vice president for financial services.

The commission published the [final text](http://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/level-2-measures/psd2-rts-2017-7782_en.pdf) at midday, Central European Time.

One of the most closely watched aspects of the standards has been whether third-party providers will be allowed to gain account access via the consumer’s online banking interface — known as screen scraping — or whether they will be forced to use an interface provided by the bank.

As [reported](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-settles-psd2-technical-standards) by PaymentsCompliance in October, the final commission text has suggested a compromise.

If a bank builds a well-functioning dedicated interface and makes it available for three months’ market testing, national regulators can grant that interface a seal of approval.

That would mean any authorised third party would have to use that interface in order to provide payment initiation or account information services.

According to today’s final text, that exemption would only be granted if the dedicated interface “been widely used for at least three months by payment service providers to offer account information services, payment initiation services and to provide confirmation on the availability of funds for card- based payments”.

However, if a bank’s interface is not approved and it suffers a technical outage, third parties can use the consumer interface as a “fallback” option — providing they identify themselves to the bank involved.

“Unplanned unavailability or a systems breakdown may be presumed to have arisen when five consecutive requests for access to information for the provision of payment initiation services or account information services are not replied to within 30 seconds,” the text states.

Banks will have to communicate details of their contingency plan to any payment service provider attempting to gain access, and to the national regulator.

A bank that has been granted an exemption can have it revoked by the regulator after two weeks if unforeseen problems arise and are not resolved.

The European Commission said it hopes that final arrangement will strike a balance between the two contrasting arguments set out by banks and fintechs.

Third parties accused banks of deliberately developing dedicated interfaces that would restrict their activities, while banks said screen scraping represents a major risk to consumers’ data security.

The commission has made few changes to the provisions on strong authentication.

A system of exemptions based on fraud rates has been retained, despite [questions](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/legal-view-psd2-and-strong-authentication) over how it will work in practice.

An exemption for certain business-to-business payments that involve “dedicated payment processes or protocols that are only made available to payers who are not consumers” has been added — a provision that will be welcomed by the online travel retail sector.

The ability for payers to “whitelist” certain payees has also been unchanged, despite calls for clarity over whether that can be used to cover card transactions as well as credit transfers.

The European Parliament and Council now have three months — which can be extended to six — to decide whether to approve or reject the standards.

Although a rejection would be disastrous for the commission, officials [reiterated](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/commission-confident-lawmakers-will-approve-psd2-standards) they are confident the standards will pass as they have “worked closely” with the other two legislative bodies during the redrafting process.

### PSD2: Questions Resurface Over Credential Sharing

9TH FEB 2018 | WRITTEN BY: [JOHN BASQUILL](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/johnbpaymentscompliancecom) & [FRAN WARBURTON](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/franwgamblingcompliancecom)

**Banks and fintechs remain at odds over whether consumers will be able to share their online banking login credentials with third parties under incoming EU-wide security standards.**

Several projects currently underway in Europe to develop application programming interfaces (APIs) for third-party access have used a “redirect” model for carrying out customer authentication.

That means a consumer wishing to use a payment initiation service when shopping online, for example, would be forwarded onto a login screen operated by their bank rather than share their login details with the third party.

However, after [complaints](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/%E2%80%98authentication-redirection%E2%80%99-proves-problematic-under-psd2) that would result in a clumsy and fragmented checkout process, the European Commission made reference to the practice in changes to regulatory technical standards that will accompany the revised [Payment Services Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal) (PSD2).

It said that banks [would not be allowed](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-takes-tough-line-psd2-%E2%80%98redirection%E2%80%99) to obstruct third parties’ business models, [giving the example](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-adopts-psd2-technical-standards) of “imposing redirection” as a practice that may result in a bank’s API not gaining the approval of its national regulator.

Speaking in a personal capacity at an industry event last week, European Commission unit head Ralf Jacob reiterated that message.

“If, for instance, there was a redirection to a page that was not properly formatted or would not really fit into the customer journey as designed by the third-party provider, there would be a problem and we would not like to see that,” he said.

However, Jacob said that some industry participants or national regulators, particularly in Nordic countries, were alarmed as they “interpreted that as a prohibition on redirection”.

There are two widely used alternatives to the redirect currently on the market; both are variants of the “pass through” model, which involves a third party transmitting authentication details to the bank.

The first alternative — an embedded pass-through — has long been used by existing payment initiation services, which collect a user’s login details and transmit them to the account-holding bank.

A decoupled pass-through, however, involves parallel authentication by the bank and the third party, without the customer journey being taken out of the third party’s hands.

That arrangement can be used in arrangements where there is an external authentication system, such as a national ID database.

In situations where a decoupled pass-through is not feasible, third parties are calling for the embedded pass-through to be made available.

“Customer authentication via redirection to [banks’] websites would be a conversion killer,” said Ralf Ohlhausen, a director at fintech firm PPRO and member of the Euro Retail Payments Board's (ERPB) working group on payment initiation.

“That would deprive third-party providers from offering their own end-to-end service via mobile app, and it would really only work for e-commerce.”

Ohlhausen suggested that if the commission did not trust payment initiation service providers to handle users’ online banking login credentials safely, it would have explicitly prohibited credential sharing in the level one text.

Existing interbank payment services that use a redirect model, such as iDEAL in the Netherlands, are not considered third parties under PSD2, he added.

Gijs Boudewijn, chairman of the European Banking Federation’s Payments System Committee, admitted there “is a lot of confusion” around the legality of credential sharing.

“Our understanding is that [banks] can mandate the current strong customer authentication methods through a redirect, but it must be well implemented in the API and provide for a good customer journey,” he explained.

“Otherwise it might create an ‘obstacle’, which might be a reason for national competent authorities not to grant an [exemption for the fallback mechanism](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/eba-takes-technical-standards-battle-commission).

“That is the incentive for [banks] to provide good APIs, which I believe will be one of the issues we will have to address in the new API evaluation group.”

The evaluation group met for the first time last week, with the commission [hoping](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/psd2-commission-pins-hopes-new-api-working-group) it will be able to develop access mechanisms that are satisfactory both to banks and third-party providers.

According to a [report](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/retpaym/shared/pdf/8th-ERPB-meeting/PIS_working_group_report.pdf?483e4d28242cd84322850a01e549d116) by the ERPB payment initiation working group published in November last year, the national APIs under development in the UK, Poland and Slovakia are all built around a redirect model.

France’s STET project uses a pass-through, while the Berlin Group API can support a redirect model or either pass-through option.

### Mixed Reviews For Leaked EU Fintech Plan

15TH FEB 2018 | WRITTEN BY: [DOUGLAS CLARKE-WILLIAMS](https://paymentscompliance.com/users/douglascpaymentscompliancecom)

**A draft action plan for fintech recently leaked from the European Commission has raised concerns about the pace and feasibility of the accelerating drive for regulatory alignment.**

Diagnosing the uneven adoption of different aspects of fintechs between member states as a result of too much variance in national regulatory regimes, the [action plan](http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Draft-FinTech-Action-Plan.pdf) highlights recent activities by the commission to ease the operation of fintechs between jurisdictions.

It follows a [consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/finance-consultations-2017-fintech_en) on fintech in the EU, which ran between March and June last year.

The paper suggested the use of “targeted initiatives” to encourage fintech adoption rather than large-scale legislative or regulatory actions, with a particular focus on those aspects where variation between jurisdictions was greatest.

This included licensing, the use of cloud services and blockchain, and cybersecurity concerns.

The paper’s aims “would entail lowering barriers that innovative models may face, supporting the uptake of new technologies and creating a vibrant borderless environment for fintech while ensuring that potential risks are adequately monitored and mitigated”.

Some commenters expressed concern over just how these ideals could work in practice, particularly considering the ongoing struggle to bring all member states up to the same level for even those major initiatives, such as the [4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/4th-amld-portal) (4th AMLD), the deadline for which has long passed.

Simon Deane-Johns, a consultant solicitor at Keystone Law, held issue with the commission's ambitions when it came to licensing.

“It troubles me slightly as to what the purpose of that is,” he said to PaymentsCompliance.

The crux of the matter in this case lays in whether the commission is planning to prune national regulation which, for example, leads to crowdfunding initiatives falling under the definition of banking activities and being, therefore, inhospitable to smaller innovative companies.

But Deane-Johns remained sceptical of the possibility of targeted EU action having a comprehensive effect on local fintech growth.

“To the extent that it does remove regulatory obstacles in some markets, that might be helpful in those markets in encouraging innovation [but] that’s an incredibly localised assessment to make,” he said.

“If your expectation is to kickstart markets with regulation I think it’s incredibly rare to see that happen.”

The draft action plan drew attention to the fact that there is currently no EU-level regulation on crowdfunding, and noted that many respondents to the consultation had said that the variance in regulation among those 11 member states who had addressed the issue made scaling up across the continent difficult.

However, Jacqui Hatfield, head of the financial services regulatory team in London at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, said that this was, if anything, an overdue issue for Europe to be dealing with.

“We shouldn’t be in a situation now where crowdfunding is dealt with in different ways in different member states,” she said

“Harmonisation is required to prevent potential liability issues and to enable effective passporting.”

The commission also observed that this situation is pertinent to those in the virtual currency sector, where there is likewise little in the way of overarching EU guidance.

“Further efforts are needed to identify existing diverging licensing requirements affecting fintech firms,” the plan said.

“Follow-up action could include: clarifying the applicable EU legislative framework for services; assessing the need for an EU framework to cover new innovative business models; and providing guidance to national supervisors to ensure more convergence between national regulatory regimes.”

Hatfield welcomed the plan’s emphasis on cybersecurity, citing examples where a lack of attention to public confidence in security has poured cold water on industry’s efforts to reform — most notably the revised [Payment Services Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal)(PSD2) and open banking initiatives.  

For industry representatives in the UK, however, the commission’s draft  was simply another thread in the rich tapestry of Brexit regulatory concerns.

“The main point, unfortunately here, is Brexit: how/whether, given Brexit, the UK’s financial services sector can remain an integral part of the digitalisation of financial services and how it develops both at EU-level and world-wide,” said Ruth Milligan, head of the financial services and payments programme at techUK.

She pointed to a mention in the plan of fresh EU regulation on data flows in relation to cloud services, even as the UK dawdles over its future commitment to the existing [General Data Protection Regulation](https://paymentscompliance.com/gdpr-portal) (GDPR) standard.

Ironically, many of the proposals in this plan, such as the idea for a network of sandboxes across member states, originated in the UK.

“In a lot of cases they, on a European level, are going to be following what we’re already doing in the UK,” Hatfield observed.
