[Tokenika](http://tokenika.io/) is an IT company set up by a group of crypto-space entrepreneurs based in Poland, one of the largest crypto-markets in Europe.

We've been closely following all of Dan Larimer's DPOS-based projects since 2014, so it was a natural choice for us to align our business activity with EOS from its very inception. While we have a lot of respect for Ethereum achievements, we see much greater business potential in EOS and that's why back in June 2017 we started making various contributions to the emerging ecosystem.

As far as technology is concerned, we are in the process of creating EOS development tools, including [TEOS](https://github.com/tokenika/teos), an EOS programming interface, and also participate in [the community testnet](https://github.com/michaeljyeates/10mill/blob/master/README.md). We are building our own in-house expertise, as well as establishing business connections with reputable IT companies interested in entering the blockchain domain (e.g. [Aply](https://aply.eu/), [Ragnarson](https://ragnarson.com/), [Espeo](http://espeo.eu/)).

We are quite active on the business front as well. We've been engaged in talks with a couple of companies seriously considering building or migrating their business to EOS (e.g. [Builder Commerce](http://buildercommerce.com/)) and VC funds interested in investing in blockchain-based startups utilizing EOS (e.g. [Speedup Group](http://speedupgroup.com/en/)). Apart from that, we've set out to create our own EOS dApp taking advantage of the opportunities created by [the European PSD2 legislation](https://www.evry.com/en/news/articles/psd2-the-directive-that-will-change-banking-as-we-know-it/).

Recently we have established a partnership with [BitSpace](https://bitspace.no/), a Norwegian-based technology company, and its [Etheos](https://etheos.io/) initiative, a business alliance whose goal is to attract businesses to the EOS ecosystem. As Etheos partners, we are in the process of on-boarding a big MMO producer, [Artplant](http://artplant.no/), who is building a large-scale blockchain-based MMO called [Parsec Frontiers](http://parsecfrontiers.com/), which has the potential to become a flagship dApp on EOS, as it perfectly utilizes EOS key features: scalability & lack of transaction fees.

We also strive to take good care of EOS publicity. We have presented EOS on several meetups both in Poland (e.g. [Warsaw](https://www.facebook.com/events/903326303125907/), [Wroclaw](https://www.meetup.com/Wroclaw-Blockchain-Meetup/events/246349912/), [Lodz](https://www.facebook.com/events/160585741214328/)) and Europe (e.g. [Oslo](https://steemit.com/eos/@bitspace/bitspace-hosts-scandinavia-s-first-ever-eos-meetup-in-oslo-norway)). Recently we had the opportunity to give a 30-minute talk about EOS at a high-profile event in Warsaw called [Blockchain Connect](http://connectwarsaw.org/).

As far as social media are concerned, we have managed to build following on [Steem](https://steemit.com/@tokenika) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tokenika_io) (including the Polish Minister of Digital Affairs), enroll 300+ people on [EOS Poland Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EOSPolska/).

Regarding [our website](http://tokenika.io/) and overall visual design, we're in the process of completely redoing it, to make it look much more cool & professional.

Why are we making all those contributions? Our main medium-term goal is gaining reputation and getting elected as an EOS witness. We have the experience & infrastructure required for this role thanks to close partnership with a successful Polish-based [Steem witness](https://steemit.com/@gtg).

Now, we want to push it even further. As we've seen a lot of interest in EOS from large-scale businesses in Poland & Europe, it makes perfect sense for us to expand the process of introducing EOS to them and assisting them to utilize it. And this is something we'd like to discuss with block.one - how to enable us to substantially expand our on-boarding activity and give our actions proper backing & structure.
