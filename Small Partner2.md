[Tokenika](http://tokenika.io/) is an IT company set up by a group of crypto-space entrepreneurs based in Poland, one of the largest crypto-markets in Europe.

We've been closely following all of Dan Larimer's DPOS-based projects since 2014, so it was a natural choice for us to align our business activity with EOS from its very inception. As we see a lot of business potential in EOS, since June 2017 we've been making various contributions to the emerging ecosystem:

* EOS development tools, including [TEOS](https://github.com/tokenika/teos), an alternative, cross-platform programming interface for EOS.
* Building our own in-house expertise, as well as partnering with established IT companies interested in entering the blockchain domain (e.g. [Aply](https://aply.eu/), [Ragnarson](https://ragnarson.com/), [Espeo](http://espeo.eu/)).
* Consultation services for companies seriously considering building or migrating their business to EOS (e.g. [Parsec Frontiers](http://parsecfrontiers.com/), [Builder Commerce](http://buildercommerce.com/)).
* Building relationships with VC funds interested in investing in blockchain-based startups utilizing EOS (e.g. [Speedup Group](http://speedupgroup.com/en/)).
* Presenting EOS at high-profile events (e.g. [Blockchain Connect](http://connectwarsaw.org/) in Warsaw) and several meetups both in Poland (e.g. [Warsaw](https://www.facebook.com/events/903326303125907/), [Wroclaw](https://www.meetup.com/Wroclaw-Blockchain-Meetup/events/246349912/), [Lodz](https://www.facebook.com/events/160585741214328/)) & Europe (e.g. [Oslo](https://steemit.com/eos/@bitspace/bitspace-hosts-scandinavia-s-first-ever-eos-meetup-in-oslo-norway)).
* Active on social media: [Steem](https://steemit.com/@tokenika), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tokenika_io) & [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EOSPolska/).

Apart from that, we've set out to create our own EOS dApp taking advantage of the opportunities created by [the European PSD2 legislation](https://www.evry.com/en/news/articles/psd2-the-directive-that-will-change-banking-as-we-know-it/).

Why are we making all those contributions? Our main medium-term goal is gaining reputation and getting elected as an EOS witness. We have the experience & infrastructure required for this role thanks to close partnership with a successful Polish-based [Steem witness](https://steemit.com/@gtg).

Now, we want to push it even further. As we've seen a lot of interest in EOS from large-scale businesses in Poland & Europe, it makes perfect sense for us to expand the process of introducing EOS to them and assisting them to utilize it. And this is something we'd like to discuss with block.one - how to enable us to substantially expand our on-boarding activity and give our actions proper backing & structure.
