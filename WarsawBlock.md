## ad 1. Our background

* Our background is very wide - spanning from the manufacturing industry, real-estate, education and public agencies. We're strongly based in reality:
  * We run real businesses employing several hundreds of people. 
  * One of us runs a real-estate association with over 8k members.
  * One of us, Krzysztof Piech, is a publicly known figure promoting the crypto industry in the mainstream media and state agenesis.
  * We have active business connections with China.
* We are blockchain veterans. We started with BTC and went through the mining phase. Then we repeated the same success with ETH and other major projects. In most cases we invest and hold.
* We actively participate in the blockchain space. This year alone we've been to the FinTech Week in London and Blockchain Summit in Shanghai. We've talked to the people behind some the major projects, including Ethereum, Iota, Factom, Gnosis.



## ad 2. Quick survey "State of the blockchain today"

- What is the total of BTC mining revenue per day? (12 mln USD / day)
- How much are we spending on BTC and ETH mining per year? (5 bln USD, which is much more then the total of all ICOs)
- What is BTC average transaction fee? What about ETH? (3 USD & 0.30 USD)
- How many transactions per second is BTC able process? What about ETH? (4 trxn/sec & 30 trxn/sec)
- Which are the four top blockchains currently in production which handle the biggest number of transactions? (BTC, ETH, Steem, BitShares)
- How many transactions per second does Facebook require? What about Visa? (50k trxn/sec, 2k trxn/sec)
- What is the current record of transaction processing in the crypto-space? (3k trxn/sec by BitShares)





## ad 3. Major problems facing the crypto-space as of 2017

- Scalability

  Scalability is considered to be the number one problem facing all major blockchains, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. The only way to tackle this issue boils down to relying on a second layer of transaction processing: Lightening Network for Bitcoin and Raiden for Ethereum. Is it any good? Well, kind of.  Those solutions are based on so called state channels: you make a series of off-chain transactions and when you're done you settle them on-chain. So it's best suited for recurrent payments between the same parties. And it doesn't handle smart-contracts.

  Ethereum has also got a scaling solution called Plasma, which is basically a tree of chains. There are two major problems with it: it's still just at a proof-of-concept stage and it's inherently less secure.

- High/unpredictable transaction fees

  It has become evident that none of the many businesses currently being built on Bitcoin or Ethereum can have any economic viability at the current level of transaction fees. As fees are entirely under block producers’ control, the only way to address this problem is to rely on the second layer transaction processing, which I've just described, and assume that transaction fees applied there will be significantly lower.

- Private key security

  How to handle the inevitable problem of people losing access to their blockchain accounts? It can happen for various reasons: they get hacked, they forget their passwords, they lose their mobile phones or computers. Apparently there is no solution currently available. The experts say this is the "inherent" feature of a blockchain. Is it really the case? Bear with me and we'll find out quite soon.

- Blockchain governance

  This problem has been raised for a long time by the smartest people in the space. How to make decisions in a decentralized environment? And I mean decisions in business-as-usual situations (e.g. budgeting) as well as decisions needed in emergency situations (when something goes seriously wrong, e.g. the DAO).

  You need to have an efficient voting system in place. Bitcoin has none. Project like Ethereum or Dash have some kind of voting in place. But imagine what happens when there is a moral dilemma? When different groups of community expect different outcomes - is a fork the only way out? Or when there is an emergency and there is no time for voting - you need to act immediately?

- Smart-contracts running amok

  One possible solution preventing smart-contracts getting out of control is to find a way to formally verify their code before they are deployed. The problem is that it's very hard in practice. Formal verification makes things difficult. And as of now, it just reduces the risk but does not give 100% guarantee the code will run as expected. So you can make a lot of effort, but still you need to be able to handle a black swan. Or you're out business.

  Look at the schizophrenia Ethereum needs to demonstrate in order to justify its existence. They clearly try to eat the cake and still have the cake. Their website still says: *Build **unstoppable** applications*. Right, unstoppable, this is what it says. Are they really unstoppable? We all remember the DAO, don't we?

  Please don't get me wrong. I'm not making a judgement about the way they sorted out the mess. I'm making a judgement about them being unprepared to handle the situation in an orderly manner. And guess what? No lesson seems to be learned - they are as unprepared now as they were back then. Clearly handling a smart-contract running amok is not part of their business.

- Confidentiality of transactions

  This is a tough one. How to reconcile our desire for confidentiality with our desire for transparency? When business A does a deal with business B, does it have to be visible to the rest of the world including their competition? In traditional business we are used to the notion of trade secrets, so if we want to build blockchain-based solutions for real-life businesses, we need to somehow address this requirement.



## ad 4. EOS presentation

* #### What is EOS? 

  * An operating system for building decentralized applications. Its *raison d'être* is similar to Ethereum's yet EOS tackles a much wider problem.
  * Evolution: payment system >> smart-contract system >> operating system for decentralized applications.

* #### What features make EOS unique when compared to Ethereum?

  * Processing power
  * Addressing a much wider context
  * Complete operating system (including embedded storage solution)
  * Web Assembly as a compiler
  * No transaction fees
  * Concept proved in practice

* #### What are EOS weak points?

  * Low awareness and quite a lot of negative (undeserved?) perception
  * Almost non-existent ecosystem and very few developers
  * Not live yet

* #### What are EOS strong points?
  * Small (26 devs) yet very efficient & experienced team
  * Rare combination of the top talents in the crypto-space, entrepreneurial skills, and strong financial backing
  * Commitment to spend 1 bln USD to boost the ecosystem



## ad 5. About Tokenika

* #### What we do?

  * Our focus is on blockchain-based fundraising and digital asset management. Projects like NeuFund, Melonport are Iconomy are the best approximation of the domain we want to be in.

    We believe that just as there has been an ICO frenzy on Ethereum for the last couple of months,  there will be a similar one on EOS. This time by businesses who actually want to build production-ready apps, not prototypes or proofs of concept. Real apps used by real people, i.e. not only blockchain folks.

    So we want to be prepared for this happening: businesses wanting to raise funds and investors wanting to risk funds, and then manage their cryptocurrency portfolio in a convenient & secure manner.

  * We are setting up a software house dedicated to building dApps (both on EOS and ETH). We are already experimenting with EOS smart-contracts and already have third-parties manifesting interest in using us to convert their ideas into EOS apps.

  * As far as EOS is concerned, we aim to become one of 20 block producers (called *witnesses*) once the system goes live. 

    How realistic is that? Unless you are a major stakeholder of EOS (which we are not), the only way to do it is via building a strong reputation in EOS community. How do you di that? By doing things which are considered to be beneficial for EOS and its ecosystem by its community. As you can see we've been doing various things to this end and actually this very presentation is part of the process.

    And obviously you need to be able to handle building the server infrastructure and make it both robust and secure. I guess we can manage that as our main advisor, who prefers to remain anonymous, is already a witness for Steem.

* #### What we need?

  * Contrary to most folks out there, we're not looking for money. We are looking for ways to spend money.
  * Looking for good ideas that can be converted into dApps.
  * Hiring developers with background in C++ and/or ETH smart-contracts.
