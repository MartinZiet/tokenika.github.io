## ad 1. Our background

* We have a strong background spanning from the manufacturing industry, real-estate, education and public agencies. We're strongly based in reality:
  * We run real businesses employing several hundreds of people. 
  * One of us runs a real-estate association with over 8k members.
  * One of us, Krzysztof Piech, is a publicly known figure promoting the crypto industry in the mainstream media and state agenesis.
  * We have active business connections with China.
* We are blockchain veterans. We started with BTC, went though the mining phase. Then we repeated the same success with ETH and other successful projects. In most cases we invest and hold.
* We actively participate in the blockchain space. This year alone we've been to the FinTech Week in London and Blockchain Summit in Shanghai. We've talked to the people behind some the major projects, including Ethereum, Iota, Factom, Gnosis.



## ad 2. Quick survey "State of the blockchain today"

- What is the total of BTC mining revenue per day? (12 mln USD / day)
- How much are we spending on BTC and ETH mining per year? (5 bln USD, which is much more then the total of all ICOs)
- What is BTC average transaction fee? What about ETH? (3 USD & 0.30 USD)
- How many transactions per second can BTC process? What about ETH? (4 trxn/sec & 30 trxn/sec)
- Which are the four top blockchains currently in production which handle the biggest number of transactions? (BTC, ETH, Steem, BitShares)
- How many transactions per second does Facebook require? What about Visa? (50k trxn/sec, 2k trxn/sec)
- What is the current record of transaction processing in the crypto-space? (3k trxn/sec by BitShares)





## ad 3. Major problems facing the crypto-space as of 2017

- Scalability

- High/unpredictable transaction fees

- Private key security

- Blockchain governance

- Smart-contracts running amok

- Confidentiality of transactions



## ad 4. EOS presentation

* #### What is EOS? 

  * An operating system for executing smart-contracts. Its *raison d'Ãªtre* is similar to Ethereum's yet EOS tackles a much wider problem.
  * Evolution: payment system >> smart-contract system >> operating system for decentralized applications.

* #### What features make EOS unique when compared to Ethereum?

  * Processing power
  * Addressing a much wider context
  * Complete operating system (including embedded storage solution)
  * Web Assembly as a compiler
  * No transaction fees
  * Concept proved in practice

* #### What are EOS weak points?

  * Low awareness and a lot of negative perception
  * Almost non-existent ecosystem and very few developers
  * Not live yet

* #### What are EOS strong points?
  * small yet very efficient and experienced team
  * combination of the top talents in the crypto-space, entrepreneurial skills, and strong financial backing
  * commitment to spend 1 bln USD to boost the ecosystem



## ad 5. About Tokenika

* #### What we do?

  * Our focus is on blockchain-based fundraising and digital asset management. Projects like NeuFund,  Melonport are Iconomy are the best approximation of our domain. 
  * We are setting up a software house dedicated to building dApps (both on EOS and ETH).
  * Regarding EOS we aim to become a witness once the system goes live. (Our main advisor is already a witness for Steem).

* #### What we need?

  * Looking for good ideas that can be converted into dApps.
  * Hiring developers with background in C++ and/or ETH smart-contracts.
