* #### What features make EOS unique when compared to Ethereum?

  * Processing power
  * Addressing a much wider context
  * Complete operating system (including embedded storage solution)
  * Web Assembly as a compiler
  * No transaction fees
  * Concept proved in practice

* #### What are EOS weak points?

  * Low awareness and a lot of negative perception
  * Almost non-existent ecosystem and very few developers
