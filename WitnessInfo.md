# 3. TECH SPECS

> Estimate of technical specifications and total expenditure for resources by June 3, 2018 - posted to Steem blockchain. Check mark given for any estimate, modesty encouraged by permanent Steem record. Quality and accuracy of effort will be judged by the EOS community.

- We are using tier 3+ datacenters across Poland (in 3 different cities) with plenty of room for growth (20-40U in each). Available now, more if needed.
- Datacenter standards are described [here](https://www.colocationamerica.com/data-center/tier-standards-overview.htm).
- We'll have 3 main servers: *Nike*, *Wawel* & *Hanys* (Dual Xeon E5-2687W with 512RAM ECC DDR4). Plus a bunch of other boxes powering our base infrastructure. 
- That gives 24 cores (48 threads) per machine, which powered by up to 3.5GHz gives excellent single-core performance.
- At least two of them will be available from day one to deal with our basic needs.
- They served us well for months, we are switching from SSDs to NVMes, as their base storage and adding some RAM.

# 4. SCALING PLAN

> Estimated scaling plan for hardware after June 3, 2018 - posted to Steem blockchain. Rough outlines receive a check mark, open review gauges the effort.

- Actually it's not the hardware specs that make us feel ready for EOS launch. It's the ability to scale rapidly. We are expecting the unexpected.
- Aside from the above hardware that we are provisioning for EOS, we will have access to powerful infrastructure that our partners can make available to us within minutes. They have practically unlimited resources and are able to expand our infrastructure by orders of magnitude.
- Additionally, we plan to use cloud solutions, including SDDC (software-defined datacenter).
- Initially, when nobody knows what the actual demand for processing power is going to be, we'll be to some degree dependent on our partners (i.e. external providers). However when the dust settles (most probably by September), we'll be aiming to have our own machines in order to become less depended on our external partners, while still keeping a close relationship with them to be able to scale quickly.

# 5. COMMUNITY BENEFIT

> Community benefit project outline, only for projects expected to be public by June 3, 2018 - posted to Steem blockchain.

* [EOSPROJECTS](https://eosprojects.org), a comprehensive listing of all tools and initiatives making up the EOS ecosystem.
* EOS Block Explorer, not only explorer but also a tool for monitoring witnesses' performance, similar to Steem's [SteemDB](https://steemdb.com).
* [LOGOS](https://github.com/tokenika/logos), a framework for compiling, testing and deploying EOS smart-contracts, similar to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com).
