# Who are we?

Tokenika is group of cryptospace entrepreneurs based in Poland, the biggest cryptomarket in Europe. We started with Bitcoin, then we were early adopters of BitShares, Steem and Ethereum, and now we bet on EOS. Generally, we specialize in blockchain systems based on Delegated Proof of Stake.

Our primary focus is participation in building EOS infrastructure. Apart from that, we're active in three domains: long-term digital assets investments, blockchain consultancy and software house for building decentralized applications.

As we have direct access to venture capital (both public and private), we also act as an incubator for start-ups around DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology).

# Why DPOS?

#### What is DPOS?

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. Perhaps most importantly, the consensus protocol is designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference.

#### Software house for EOS/ETH dApps

When Android was entering the market, the best strategy for Android-based businesses was to identify the most successful apps on iOS and implement them on Android. We want to follow a similar path with EOS, as we believe that EOS, once launched in Q3 2018, will be much more scalable, business-oriented and production-ready than Ethereum.
