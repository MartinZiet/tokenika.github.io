# Who are we?

BitSpace is an incubator focusing on creating synergies between exponential technologies, such as cryptocurrency, the Internet of Things, BCI, VR and AI. We combine these technologies to create new, innovative and disruptive solutions for the future. BitSpace is also an excellence center and does Bitcoin and blockchain consultancy. We build tailored blockchain solutions for our customers and arrange courses and seminars for businesses and for people in private.

# Delegated Proof of Stake

#### What is it?

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All network parameters, from fee schedules to block intervals and transaction sizes, can be tuned via elected delegates. Deterministic selection of block producers allows transactions to be confirmed in an average of just 1 second. Perhaps most importantly, the consensus protocol is designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference.

Bitspace is an incubator of startup companies. These business models incorporate technologies such as Blockchain, Space, Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality. For consideration please contact us directly.

#### Software house for EOS/ETH dApps

When Android was entering the market, the best strategy for Android-based businesses was to identify the most successful apps on iOS and implement them on Android. We want to follow a similar path with EOS, as we believe that EOS, once launched in Q3 2018, will be much more scalable, business-oriented and production-ready than Ethereum.
