# Who are we?

Tokenika is an IT company set up by a group of crypto-space entrepreneurs based in Poland, one of the largest crypto-markets in Europe.

We started with Bitcoin, then we became early adopters of BitShares, MaidSafe, Ethereum & Steem, and now we bet on [EOS](https://eos.io/), the first-ever blockchain operating system.

We've been closely following all of Dan Larimer's DPOS-based projects since 2014, so it was a natural choice for us to align our business activity with EOS from its very inception. 

# Why blockchain?

Blockchain is a simple concept -  it's an irreversible public record that's replicated across multiple computers all over the world. It's simple, yet it has profound & multidimensional consequences - just like the invention of the Internet 20 years ago.

Blockchain has many aspects, which extend much further than just creating crypto-currencies & raising funds. Firstly, it's the ultimate implementation of freedom of speech - whatever you put on the blockchain, stays there forever, nobody is able to remove it. Secondly, it facilitates the creation of useful incentive schemes which, if done properly, have the ability to make people act voluntarily in an efficient & fair manner.

What's an incentive scheme? Imagine you have two children and you want to find a way to split a chocolate bar in such a way that both of them feel being treated fairly. What's the best way to do it? Just let one child split the bar and the other choose one of the pieces. Children will quickly figure out that there is no way to cheat this system - acting fairly is the only viable strategy.

# Why DPOS?

#### What is DPOS?

In the heart of every blockchain there needs to be a consensus mechanism which allows multiple entities to establish one version of truth. There are various ways to achieve that and [Delegated Proof of Stake](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/) (DPOS) is one of them - it uses stakeholder approval voting for resolving consensus issues. In DPOS block producers are elected by token holders, each voting according to their stake, and each able to revoke their vote any time they want.

#### Why we focus on DPOS?

We believe DPOS is the best trade-off one could make in a decentralized environment. It's arguably the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. It's not without deficiencies (e.g. voters' apathy), yet it has been proven to work in real-life situations and remained both resilient and extremely efficient, both in terms of processing power but also in terms of decentralized governance. Furthermore, it's designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference.

#### Which blockchain systems use DPOS?

As of now, DPOS is probably the most quickly adopted consensus mechanism in the blockchain industry. It was first introduced in [BitShares](https://bitshares.org/) back in 2014 and [Steem](https://steem.io/) in 2016. Since then several other projects have borrowed Dan Larimer's invention, including [Lisk](https://lisk.io/), [Cardano](https://www.cardanohub.org) & [Ark](https://ark.io/). Needless to say, DPOS is going to be a crucial part of EOS.

# Why EOS?

It all started with [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org), which is about simple payments. Then came [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), which is about smart-contracts, i.e. automating those simple payments and making them conditional. Now we have [EOS](https://eos.io/), which is about turning those smart-contracts into full-blown [decentralized applications](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/).

In other words, EOS is about building real-life businesses on the blockchain. It takes the notion of smart-contracts to the next level, by providing an operating system on which they can run. In a way, it's similar to what Android or IOS did for the smartphone.

# What we do?

#### Contributing to EOS ecosystem

We're creating [TEOS](https://github.com/tokenika/teos), an alternative, cross-platform programming interface for EOS. Our long-term goal is to offer a toolset similar to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).

#### Bringing businesses to EOS

We do consultancy services for companies that consider building or migrating large-scale businesses to EOS. So far we've been working with [Parsec Frontiers](http://parsecfrontiers.com/), [Builder Commerce](http://buildercommerce.com/), [Just Drive](http://justdrive.co/).

#### Software house for EOS dApps

We're accumulating our own in-house expertise, as well as partnering with established IT companies interested in entering the blockchain domain.

#### Contributing to EOS publicity

We've been presenting EOS at high-profile events (e.g. [Blockchain Connect](http://connectwarsaw.org/) in Warsaw) and several meetups both in Poland (e.g. [Warsaw](https://www.facebook.com/events/903326303125907/), [Wroclaw](https://www.meetup.com/Wroclaw-Blockchain-Meetup/events/246349912/), [Lodz](https://www.facebook.com/events/160585741214328/)) & Europe (e.g. [Oslo](https://steemit.com/eos/@bitspace/bitspace-hosts-scandinavia-s-first-ever-eos-meetup-in-oslo-norway)).

#### Building EOS infrastructure

Our medium-term goal is being elected as one of EOS block producers (a.k.a EOS witness). We have the experience & infrastructure required for this role through close partnership with a successful [Steem witness](https://steemit.com/@gtg).

#### PSD2 dApp on EOS

We've set out to create our own dApp to be deployed on EOS. We're taking advantage of the opportunities introduced by [the European PSD2 legislation](https://www.evry.com/en/news/articles/psd2-the-directive-that-will-change-banking-as-we-know-it/) by creating a blockchain-based authorization layer for third-party providers.

#### Start-up incubator

If you have a good idea which could be turned into a large-scale dApp, we can help you with implementing it. We have access to VC funds interested in investing in startups utilizing EOS (e.g. [Speedup Group](http://speedupgroup.com/en/)).

#### Digital assets investments

Our focus is on blockchain-based fundraising and long-term digital asset investments. Inspired by some of the best dApps currently being built on Ethereum (e.g. [Neufund](https://neufund.org/), [Melonport](https://melonport.com/)), we aim to offer similar solutions on EOS.
