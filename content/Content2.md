# Who are we?

Tokenika is an IT company set up by a group of crypto-space entrepreneurs based in Poland, one of the largest crypto-markets in Europe.

We started with Bitcoin, then we became early adopters of BitShares, Steem and Ethereum, and now we bet on [EOS](https://eos.io/), the first-ever blockchain operating system.

We've been closely following all of Dan Larimer's DPOS-based projects since 2014, so it was a natural choice for us to align our business activity with EOS from its very inception. 

# Why blockchain?

The blockchain is a simple concept -  it's an irreversible public record that's replicated across multiple computers all over the world. It's simple, yet it has profound & multidimensional consequences - just like the invention of the Internet 20 years ago.

For us, blockchain is not really about creating virtual currencies and running ICOs. It's foremost about the ability to create useful incentive schemes which, if done properly, can make people act in an efficient & fair manner.

What's an incentive scheme? Imagine you have two children and you want to find a way to split a chocolate bar in such a way that both feel being treated fairly. What's the best way to do it? Just let one child split the bar and the other choose one of the pieces. Children will quickly figure out that there is no way to cheat this system - acting fairly is the only viable strategy.

# Why DPOS?

#### What is DPOS?

In the heart of every blockchain there needs to be a consensus mechanism which allows multiple entities to establish one version of truth. [Delegated Proof of Stake](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/) (DPOS) is arguably the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available.

In order to resolve consensus issues in a maximally fair & efficient way, DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting. Furthermore, it's designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference.

#### Why we focus on DPOS?

We believe DPOS is the best trade-off one could make in the blockchain space. It's not without its own deficiencies (e.g. voters' apathy), yet it has been proven to work in real-life situations and remained both resilient and extremely efficient, both in terms of processing power but also in terms of decentralized governance.

#### Which blockchain systems use DPOS?

As of now, DPOS is probably the most quickly adopted consensus mechanism in the blockchain industry. It all started with [BitShares](https://bitshares.org/) back in 2014 and [Steem](https://steem.io/) in 2016. Since then several other projects have borrowed Dan Larimer's invention, including [Lisk](https://lisk.io/), [Cardano](https://www.cardanohub.org) & [Ark](https://ark.io/).

# Why EOS?

It all started with [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org), which is about simple payments. Then came [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), which is about smart-contracts, i.e. automating those simple payments and making them conditional. Now we have [EOS](https://eos.io/), which is about turning those smart-contracts into full-blown [decentralized applications](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/).

In other words, EOS is about building real-life businesses on the blockchain. It takes the notion of smart-contracts to the next level, by providing an operating system on which they can run. In a way, it's similar to what Android or IOS did for the smartphone.

# What we do?

#### Contributing to EOS ecosystem

We're creating [TEOS](https://github.com/tokenika/teos), an alternative, cross-platform programming interface for EOS. Our long-term goal is to offer a toolset similar to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).

#### Bringing businesses to EOS

We do consultancy services for companies considering building or migrating large-scale businesses to EOS. We've been working with [Parsec Frontiers](http://parsecfrontiers.com/), [Builder Commerce](http://buildercommerce.com/), [Just Drive](http://justdrive.co/).

#### Software house for EOS dApps

We're accumulating our own in-house expertise, as well as partnering with established IT companies interested in entering the blockchain domain.

#### Building EOS publicity

We've been presenting EOS at high-profile events (e.g. [Blockchain Connect](http://connectwarsaw.org/) in Warsaw) and several meetups both in Poland (e.g. [Warsaw](https://www.facebook.com/events/903326303125907/), [Wroclaw](https://www.meetup.com/Wroclaw-Blockchain-Meetup/events/246349912/), [Lodz](https://www.facebook.com/events/160585741214328/)) & Europe (e.g. [Oslo](https://steemit.com/eos/@bitspace/bitspace-hosts-scandinavia-s-first-ever-eos-meetup-in-oslo-norway)).

#### Building EOS infrastructure

Our medium-term goal is being elected as one of EOS block producers (a.k.a EOS witness). We have the experience & infrastructure required for this role through close partnership with a successful [Steem witness](https://steemit.com/@gtg).

#### Digital assets investments

Our focus is on blockchain-based fundraising and long-term digital asset investments. Inspired by some of the best dApps currently being built on Ethereum (e.g. [Neufund](https://neufund.org/), [Melonport](https://melonport.com/)), we aim to offer similar solutions on EOS.
