#### EOS main purpose

EOS is the upcoming blockchain platform for building industrial-scale decentralized applications. It's designed to be fast, scalable, flexible and, last but not least, extremely usable.

What's more, EOS aims to allow you to build decentralized applications that are indistinguishable from centralized alternatives.

This is a very bold statement, if you take into account that creating decentralized apps is not an easy task - a lot of things we take for granted when creating conventional web apps, are not easily available in a decentralized environment. Thus EOS goal is to make decentralized apps look and behave like conventional web apps.

#### How does EOS work?

The best way to describe it is to compare it with the concept of Ethereum. In Ethereum we have a bare-bone computer (called Ethereum Virtual Machine) and we have some apps trying to run on top of it. 

Those apps have a tough job to do, because apart from some basic stuff, like the ability to send funds and maybe store a little bit of data, they need to take care of pretty much everything else.

And because everything is being implemented in the application layer, it’s being done within relatively inefficient scripting environment. Which makes it really hard.

Furthermore, even if some generic solutions eventually emerge as a result of these efforts, they will be expensive to use, as every single line of their code will consume gas.

So what are we missing here?

Right, we need a blockchain operating system.

And this is what EOS is about. EOS is an operating system for running decentralized applications. Actually, it’s both. It’s a computer and an operating system on top of it.

#### About EOS genesis

Generally, there are two ways of building a smart-contract platform similar to Ethereum or EOS.

You can start by creating the whole thing, and then attempt to build some concrete apps on top of it. Most probably you’ll be confronted with tough reality when you try to make those apps actually useful. However, this is the prevailing approach in the crypto-space. Systems like Ethereum, Cardano, Neo or Lisk are being created this way.

The alternative is this: you start with building a couple of concrete, non-trivial apps, inevitably make some mistakes while doing this, learn from those mistakes, and, as a next step, figure out what’s common between your apps, and only then start building the abstraction layer.

The latter is how EOS was born. The team of developers behind EOS have already built some of the most successful blockchain apps in the crypto-space, and now they have set out to leverage their experience by building a general-purpose platform.

#### EOS features

EOS features revolve around one purpose: to help you build & run a decentralized business.

* EOS processing power makes your app fast & scalable.
* Built-in governance gives you a safety net in case things go seriously wrong in terms of bugs, or if there are any disputes around yours smart-contracts.
* Built-in infrastructure saves you a lot of development work. It also saves you a lot of operating costs, as you can rely on features which are free to use.
* The absence of transaction fees gives you full flexibility about the way you can monetize your app.
* Optional upgradeability lets you freely choose whether you want to make your app fully autonomous or be able to constantly improve it & fix bugs.
* And finally, EOS architecture based on asynchronous communication allows your app to interact with other apps not only within the same blockchain but also across other blockchains.
