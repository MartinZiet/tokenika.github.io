EOS is the upcoming blockchain platform for building industrial-scale decentralized applications. It's designed to be fast, scalable, flexible and last but not least usable.

What's more, EOS aims to open the way for building decentralized applications that are indistinguishable from centralized alternatives. This is a very bold statement, if you take into account that creating decentralized apps is not an easy task. A lot of things we take for granted when creating conventional web apps, are not easily available in a decentralized environment.

How does EOS work?

Let’s start with Ethereum. This is what Ethereum actually looks like. We have a bare-bone computer and we have some apps trying to run on top of it. 

They have a tough job to do, because apart from some basic stuff, like the ability to send funds and maybe store a little bit of data, they need to take care of pretty much everything else.

And because everything is being implemented in the application layer, it’s being done within relatively inefficient scripting environment. Which makes it really hard.

Furthermore, even if some generic solutions eventually emerge as a result of these efforts, they will be expensive to use, as every single line of their code will consume gas.

Actually, the whole thing reminds me of trying to build a mobile app on a smart-phone without having Android or iOS at your disposal.

So what are we missing here?

Right, we need a blockchain operating system.

And this is what EOS brings to the table. EOS is an operating system for running decentralized applications. Actually, it’s both. It’s a computer and an operating system on top of it.

And now I’d like to tell you a little bit about EOS genesis. 

Generally, there are two ways of building a smart-contractplatform.

■      You can start by creating the whole thing, and then attempt tobuild some concrete apps on top of it. Most probably you’ll be confronted withtough reality when you try to make those apps actually useful. However, this isthe prevailing approach in the crypto-space.

■      Or you can start with building a couple of concrete, non-trivialapps, make some mistakes while doing this, learn from those mistakes, and as anext step figure out what’s common between your apps, and only then start buildingthe abstraction layer. This is how EOS was born. The team of developers behindEOS have already built some of the most successful blockchain apps in thecrypto-space, and now they have set out to leverage their experience bybuilding a general-purpose platform.

And when I say they’ve built successful apps, what I mean is,how useful those apps are in the eyes of users. Not investors. Actual users.

Here are EOS main features again, listed together. As you cansee, everything revolves around one purpose. To help you build & run adecentralized business.

■      EOS processing power makes your app fast & scalable.

■      Built-in governance gives you a safety net in case things goseriously wrong in terms of bugs, or if there are any disputes around yoursmart-contracts.

■      Built-in infrastructure saves you a lot of development work. Italso saves you a lot of operating costs, as you can rely on features which arefree to use.

■      The absence of transaction fees gives you full flexibility aboutthe way you can monetize your app.

■      Upgradeability lets you constantly improve your app & fixbugs.

■      And finally, asynchronous communication opens you up tointeractions with other blockchains.
