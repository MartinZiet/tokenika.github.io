> The biggest challenge in the space is everyone, including the experts, has a lot to learn. There are so many different disciplines involved, everything from economics, to game theory, to software engineering, and there are so many different philosophies in play to all those things. A lot of ICOs are people who have maybe good intentions but they just don't have the experience of years of building those things, so they're repeating a lot of the same mistakes, or they're throwing tokens into things that don't need tokens, or they're making things decentralized that don't benefit from decentralization.

> EOS is fundamentally different for a few reasons. One is that it uses messaging, and not state. Which is to say you record the messages incoming and outgoing, and that's your commitment, that's what the blockchain does for you. Which means that the state is implied [from the messages]. This can be a little bit scary to people who believe in the state, but actually it's mostly equivalent from the theoretical point of view. The big difference is you can optimize messages much more than you can optimize state. We are already testing 50k transactions per second, and we know we can go higher. The same technology has been tested into the millions [transactions per second].
