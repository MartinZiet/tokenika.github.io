## Decentralization per Minute

Distribution of block production matters far more than the total number of people who can produce blocks. Specifically, it doesnâ€™t matter if 1000 people can produce blocks in a given year, if 99 out of every 100 are produced by the same individual.

The more people you attempt to involve in a consensus process, the longer it takes.

At the end of the day, speed of decentralization matters to the end user and is actually critically important to overall security. It is much easier to pull off an attack if the attacker has 7 hours than if the attacker has mere minutes.
