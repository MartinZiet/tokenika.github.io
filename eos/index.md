## [EOS - an introduction](eos-an-introduction/index.md)

Current technologies for blockchain fall short of providing what developers and end-users need in order to contract together and to build large scale businesses. We propose EOS, a performance-based and self-governing blockchain that provides an operating system for building large-scale consumerfacing distributed applications. This paper outlines the context, vision and software architecture underlying EOS, which we are building to serve a broad and diverse group of users with smart business.

## [Casper as an EOS Contract](casper-as-an-eos-contract/index.md)

DPOS, EOS consesnus mechanism, could easily be tweaked to emulate Casper, Ethereum's consensus mechanism. Whereas the opposite is not true: Casper is not able emulate DPOS. However, according to Dan Larimer, this is would not be beneficial, as DPOS, despite its limitations, is the ultimate solution in the blockchain space.

## [Dan Larimer's response to Vitalik's remarks on DPOS voting and EOS fees](reponse-to-vitaliks-remarks-on-dpos-voting-and-eos-fess/index.md)

In his remarks Vitalik brings up the issue of DPOS voting (low voter participation, tragedy-of-the-commons vulnerabilities, misalignment between coin holder interests with user interests), and the consequences of lack of fees in EOS (e.g. how to handle unexpected spikes in demand).

## [Dan Larimer's response to Vitalik's remarks on EOS](reponse-to-vitaliks-remarks-on-eos/index.md)

In his remarks Vitalik claims that EOS can process more transactions due to the fact that Ethereum has more features than EOS (and gives the lack of merkle trees as an example). Then he claims that in EOS there is no way to verify for yourself that everything is happening correctly, unless you run a resource-intensive full node. And finally, he claims that EOS scalability comes at the cost of reduced decentralization and thus increased vulnerability for the blockchain to be shut down by a government.
