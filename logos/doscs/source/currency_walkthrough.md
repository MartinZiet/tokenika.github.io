
# Example "Currency" Contract Walkthrough

We rephrase an article from an outdated EOSIO [README}](#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekkis/eos/master/README.md)

EOS comes with example contracts that can be uploaded and run for testing 
purposes. We will validate our single node setup using the sample contract 
'currency'.

## Start EOS node
```
import teos
teos.set_verbose(False)

daemon = teos.Daemon()
daemon.clear()
#       nodeos exe file: /mnt/e/Workspaces/EOS/eos/build/programs/nodeos/nodeos
#    genesis state file: /mnt/e/Workspaces/EOS/eos/build/programs/daemon/data-dir/genesis.json
#        server address: 127.0.0.1:8888
#      config directory: /mnt/e/Workspaces/EOS/eos/build/programs/daemon/data-dir
#      wallet directory: /mnt/e/Workspaces/EOS/eos/build/programs/daemon/data-dir/wallet
#     head block number: 2
#       head block time: 2018-04-10T17:20:54

# See a prove that the daemon is started:
print(daemon)
#            head block: 1047
#       head block time: 2018-04-10T16:57:27
#  last irreversible block: 1046
```
## Create a wallet

Every contract requires an associated account, so first you need to create 
a wallet. To create a wallet, you need to have the wallet_api_plugin loaded 
into the nodeos process:
```

wallet = teos.Wallet()
```
The wallet name argument is not set: the default wallet name is 'default'.

## Load the Bios Contract

You have to owe an account to be authorized to interact with EOSIO. For tests,
you can use the 'eosio' account:
```
account_eosio = teos.EosioAccount()
``` 
Set a smart contract defined in folder 
eos-source-dir/build/contracts/eosio.bios/ as the default system contract. 
This contract enables you to have direct control over the resource allocation 
of other accounts and to access other privileged API calls.
```
contract_eosio_bios = teos.SetContract(
  account_eosio, "eosio.bios", permission=account_eosio)
#        transaction id: 7d5d9c7f56d46d6eab95f2dea6aaab667b5eb3d087737ada0...
```
The second argument in the constructor indicates a directory that contains
the contract files. The path to this directory is determined with 
[setup rules](#setup). An absolute path is an option.

As the set contract command call has produced the transaction id, the default contract is operational.

## Create an account for the "currency" contract

The account named "currency" will be used for the "currency" contract. 
Generate two public/private key pairs that will be later assigned as the 
key_owner and the key_active:
```
key_owner = teos.CreateKey("key_owner")
#              key name: key_owner
#           private key: 5J4bSiNprJzPYVHqoZdSDGTTd454LiDc89AVvKT4Miv2SyzZTDF
#            public key: EOS7vDtGf9cVxEChKN7YeDgqMGrgFgvcCdN5qAUEhMMufAnPHddTb
key_active = teos.CreateKey("key_active")
#              key name: key_active
#           private key: 5KRHeQ1S7pEtCw6TMeW6WKvupuR8cVGJjpNbAN5uviXTAtvhmDW
#            public key: EOS6FfNuYYKoSa7pjhoqqeymi6iwe6j9ukVHiQxPbMeAcHmcoxRwj
```
Import the two private keys into the wallet:

wallet.import_key(key_owner)
wallet.import_key(key_active)


You can see the contents of the wallet:
```  
print(wallet)
{'keys': [['key_owner', '5J4bSiNprJzPYVHqoZdSDGTTd454LiDc89AVvKT4Miv2SyzZTDF'],
          ['key_active',
           '5KRHeQ1S7pEtCw6TMeW6WKvupuR8cVGJjpNbAN5uviXTAtvhmDW']],
 'name': 'default',
 'password': 'PW5Kih88UxyFeVeYfWiuhbBRVhxmzr4nVvyTjsuNLgP6Ropxb9SJY'}
```
Create the currency account. The creation will be authorized by the eosio 
account. The two public keys generated above will be associated with the 
account, one as its owner key and the other as its active key.
```

account_currency = teos.Account(
  account_eosio, "currency", key_owner, key_active)
#        transaction id: 0c4e0fb1163562909a83947b77aa3ee293b880cd61d4c6610f...
```
As the first argument is the authorizing account (or the name of this acconut),
the second argument specifies the name of the creation.

As the account command call has produced the transaction id, the account is 
walid. You can see its description:
```
print(account_currency)
{'account_name': 'currency',
 'permissions': [{'parent': 'owner',
                  'perm_name': 'active',
                  'required_auth': {'accounts': '',
                                    'keys': [{'key': 'EOS88rqdDApfzRMcSCTuy3Hm...',
                                              'weight': '1'}],
                                    'threshold': '1'}},
                 {'parent': '',
                  'perm_name': 'owner',
                  'required_auth': {'accounts': '',
                                    'keys': [{'key': 'EOS5WULc9uFcaME5xJbHdrrbi...',
                                              'weight': '1'}],
                                    'threshold': '1'}}]}

```
## Upload the sample "currency" contract to the blockchain

Before uploading a contract, verify that there is no current contract:
```
print(account_currency.code())
#             code hash: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000...

```
Upload the currency contract using an authorization of the currency account:
```
contract_currency = teos.Contract(account_currency, "currency")
print(contract_currency)
#        transaction id: 9c1b663cafcbe7ffbb18527fecfa7aa58237d00e02af125eed...
```
Printout is a valid transaction id.

You can also verify that the code has been set:
```
print(account_currency.code())
#             code hash: d6c891fbdfcff597d82e17c81354574399b01d533e53d41209...
```
Before using the currency contract, you must first create it: 
```
contract_currency.action(
  "create", 
  '{"issuer":"currency","maximum_supply":"1000000.0000 CUR", \
  "can_freeze":"0","can_recall":"0","can_whitelist":"0"}')
#        transaction id: afe3ed99759c637b39244556bbf14d3d49260efd37c165fb8b...
```
Now, you can issue the currency:
```
contract_currency.action(
  "issue", 
  '{"to":"currency","quantity":"1000.0000 CUR","memo":""}')
#        transaction id: fd37c165fb8bd1ec3c6faf6fbfafe3ed99759c637b39244556...
```
Verify the currency contract has the proper initial balance:
```
account_currency.accounts()
```
## Transfer funds using the "currency" contract

The following command shows a "transfer" action being sent to the currency 
contract, transferring "20.0000 CUR" from the currency account to the "eosio" 
account.
```
contract_currency.action(
  "transfer",
  '{"from":"currency","to":"eosio","quantity":"20.0000 CUR", \
    "memo":"my first transfer"}'
)
```
A successfully submitted transaction has generated a transaction ID.

## Check the "currency" contract balances

Check the state of both accounts involved in the previous transaction:
```
account_currency.accounts(account_currency)
#  {
#      "rows": [
#          {
#              "balance": "980.0000 CUR",
#              "frozen": "0",
#              "whitelist": "1"
#          }
#      ],
#      "more": "false"
#  }
#

account_eosio.accounts(account_currency)
#  {
#      "rows": [
#          {
#              "balance": "20.0000 CUR",
#              "frozen": "0",
#              "whitelist": "1"
#          }
#      ],
#      "more": "false"
#  }
#
```
