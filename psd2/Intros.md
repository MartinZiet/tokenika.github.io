# PSD2 and Blockchain: Mutual Support

[Noelle Acheson](https://www.coindesk.com/author/noelle/) Aug 7, 2017 at 09:00 UTC

**In this opinion piece, Acheson discusses upcoming regulatory changes in Europe, explaining how trends in payments rule-making may unexpectedly align with those in the blockchain sector.**

Europe is about to undergo a massive shift in regulation that will fundamentally change the payments landscape. It's also likely to give an unexpected boost to blockchain development.

Let me explain. It all starts with PSD2, a new payments directive due to come into force [in early 2018](https://www.paymentsuk.org.uk/sites/default/files/PSD2%20report%20June%202016.pdf), aims to change the way banks treat data. While that sounds relatively benign, the consequences will be anything but. Under the new rules, banks will have to share client information with licensed third parties if the client asks it to do so.

This will allow a broad range of financial services to take advantage of an important asset that until now has been treated as proprietary: customer data.

Obviously, this favors fintech companies more than it does banks, who are being ordered to give up an important component of their competitive advantage (exclusive knowledge of a client's transaction history and asset distribution) in order to help disruptors.

It also sheds light on a deeper goal: to promote innovation in the payments space, whatever the cost.

## **Shifting gears**

The prevailing view in Europe is that legacy payment rails have been holding back growth in commerce and finance. The upgrade began over 17 years ago with the harmonization of central bank systems and currencies, and reached its peak in 2014 with a massive overhaul of cross-border payments within the European Union.

PSD2 is different in that it is not upgrading current systems. It is creating new ones. Rather than figure out how to make processes more efficient, it wants to rethink how payments are made. And rather than tell market participants what the new system should look like, it wants them to figure it out for themselves. In opening up access to data, it aims to give them a powerful tool with which to do so.

Is this starting to sound familiar? It is exactly what blockchain thinkers and doers around the world are working on: how to [use new technologies](https://www.coindesk.com/information/applications-use-cases-blockchains/) to not only improve current processes but develop entirely new ones, bypassing legacy systems and unleashing a new wave of innovation - and in the process, change how people use money.

Apart from sharing a common long-term goal, PSD2 will also benefit blockchain projects by broadening business opportunities.

For example, financial institutions could end up offering [blockchain-based payment services](https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-startup-circle-launches-fee-free-cross-border-payments/)through partnerships. Bank accounts and cryptocurrency holdings [could be aggregated](https://www.coindesk.com/norways-internet-skandiabanken-launches-coinbase-integration/) on wealth management dashboards. The operations of distributed ledger trading platforms could fundamentally alter if collateral takes on a different form. And the need to protect the freely flowing data could provide fertile opportunities for providers of blockchain-enhanced security.

## **Loose change**

But zooming out even more, a stronger symbiosis emerges. Why are Europe's financial regulators so keen to kick payment efficiency up to a new level? It's part of a bigger drive, replicated in [other parts of the world](https://www.coindesk.com/india-goes-cashless-central-bank-researches-blockchain/), to replace cash.

Contemporary attempts to replace cash with electronic payments have encountered significant friction. With more fluid payment systems, however, the barriers lower. Combine that with a wide range of applications designed to help you manage your financial life with just one device, and you have a new type of service that changes how we see finance.

Given its ability to enable services to share data in a relatively decentralized and selectively transparent manner, blockchain technology could end up being part of the connective tissue of the new system. And given its ability to preserve a semblance of anonymity in electronic payments, it could help a wary public to accept the advantages of going cashless.

Here's where blockchain-based services will most likely start to go mainstream: not in replacing current systems with better processes, but in forming part of new systems in a behind-the-scenes, non-threatening role.

# PSD2 and Blockchain: How Open API Access and Better Infrastructure will Benefit Banks and Fintechs

May 18, 2016 | Bailey Reutzel

**In the era of regulated open financial services APIs, some think banks will become just the dumb pipes behind a whole host of tech-focused, consumer-facing startup projects. But in actuality, the prospects aren’t so grim.**

The critical conversation started after the European Union passed the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) at the beginning of this year, which among other things calls for banks to open up its APIs to third parties. The legislation will give fintech startups access to bank architecture and data that could help them provide better products and services to end customers.

> “There’s this knee-jerk reaction when you first talk about PSD2 to think about banks in one playpen being concerned and the fintechs in another playpen sharpening their pencils,” said Marcus Treacher, former HSBC and Swift executive and current Global Head of Strategic Accounts at Ripple. “But whether you’re a bank or a fintech, both groups are going to be able to access more data to create better tech solutions. Nothing is stopping a bank from accessing the data of other banks with those open APIs as well.”

And banks have an advantage in that it has far more experience working with regulators and complying with regulations. This advantage has already been seen in the number of fintech startups that have entered the market with rallying cries of disruption, only to soften its stance after operating in an industry that deals with considerable fraud and a strict regulatory environment.

“Banks will remain a powerful competitor to fintechs,” Treacher said.

The key objective for banks should be improving their backend for the benefit of the frontend.

Treacher and the team at Ripple believe using distributed ledger technology is the best way to do that. Distributed ledger technology stands to simplify the transaction route, making payments faster and opening up corridors that were once expensive and slow.

> “With blockchain … the rails the banks run on become high-performance rails,” Treacher said. “If you improve the tracks, then the people that make all the value-add services that go on the trains could do a much better job.”

With better infrastructure, the potential is for both startups and banks to offer improved products and services to their end users. And an infrastructure built on blockchain enabling real-time transaction reconciliation could dramatically reduce costs meaning, according to Anthony Macey, Innovation and Strategy Manager at Barclays, banks can focus on enhanced services and/or become the infrastructure third parties need to create services.

> Infrastructure built on blockchain enabling real-time settlement could dramatically reduce costs.

> “You’re just beginning to see banks adopt a platform focus, offering API services to attract the best developers,” said Danny Aranda, Ripple’s Managing Director for Europe.

Opening up financial service APIs will bring the robustness and efficiency to the Internet of Value that the current internet stack for the Web already employs. “The internet allows small teams with little capital — but a lot creativity and talent — to take a great idea, execute on it really well and take over huge markets quickly,” Aranda said.

> “We’re not at that stage yet with the internet of value … but as the stack matures over time, and there are good fundamentals in the base layers of the infrastructure through blockchain, the potential is that a small team of talented developers can create the next great financial services offering,” Aranda said. “That type of dynamic is going to be good for all stakeholders.”

# The Year of Blockchain and PSD2

Customers want their realtime payments to just work. They don’t care if you are using postal pigeons, blockchain or voodoo magic to make it happen.

#### Enter PSD2

13th of January 2018 will see the official arrival of Payment Services Directive (PSD2) from the European Commission across European Economic Area (EEA).

The first PSD, introduced back in 2009, resulted in the creation of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in 2014. Banks were forced to standardize and simplify their payment systems, resulting in lower fees and *better *customer experience.

Better, but not good enough.

In the year when chatbots, cryptocurrencies, digital wallets and instantaneous transactions are taking hold of the payments space, a variable SEPA transaction time of 1–3 days looks like a dinosaur waiting for a meteor to strike.

Customers expect 24/7 access to **their **money and ability to spend it instantaneously. Who knew…

PSD2 creates a common legal framework for businesses and consumers when making and receiving payments within the EEA and calls for banks to open up its APIs to third parties vastly increasing competition, quantity and quality of services in the payments space.

New and existing businesses will be able to step in and fix what banks across EU failed to do, either due to being too slow to innovate or simply not willing to talk to each other.

This could be one of the most important pieces of legislation that EEA seen in decades — if only there would be a technology to interconnect all the ledgers and enable secure, cheap and fast transactions…

#### Blockchain

Blockchain is the technology that powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [Digibyte](https://digibyte.io/), [Bytecoin](https://bytecoin.org/) and many others.

At first it’s hard to get over the idea that on 22nd May 2010 a software developer by the name of Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 Bitcoins ($41) for two Papa John’s pizzas, what at today’s rate would be roughly 136 million dollars (also known as the “Bitcoin Pizza Day”).

This real world transaction was an important first step in proving the viability of blockchain technology as a facilitator of payments and the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies is a testament to that.

Since then trillions of dollars worth of value has changed hands on various blockchains and there are already over a thousand blockchains with a total market cap of around **$800 billion**. Year 2018 will see creation of many more.

Blockchain technology solves a critical part required for the success of PSD2, which is removing the settlement risk between parties through *Distributed Ledger Technology*. It also makes the transaction data easily accessible to all parties with very little effort.

Projects like [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/) and [Ripple](https://ripple.com/) are extremely well positioned to provide easy and open access for innovative companies to build a new class of products and services.

While cryptocurrencies are new, hot and speculative class of assets they are also testing grounds for the blockchain technology that will ultimately enable the practical implementation of PSD2. Cryptocurrencies like [Bytecoin](https://bytecoin.org/) and [Digibyte](https://digibyte.io/) can already provide customers with near instantaneous and cheap (below 0.001$) transaction costs, and they will perfectly blend in into the PSD2 as customer facing means of payment.

So don’t be focused on Bitcoin’s price. It will go up and down, and probably crash a few times in epic proportions, but technology behind it will quickly bring about the next chapter of modern, instantaneous and cheap payments to the European continent and beyond.

Blink and you might miss it.

# PSD2 and the blockchain

May 1, 2017 by [Noelle Acheson](http://www.fintechblue.com/author/admin/)

Europe has some surprisingly progressive ideas about retail banking.

In 2018, the new payments directive (PSD2) comes into force. This will change not only how we see banking, but also how we treat data.

A bit of background: the Payments Services Directive was adopted in 2007 to create the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), aimed at simplifying and modernizing the rules and guidelines for money transfers within the European Union.

An update (PSD2) was passed by the European Parliament in 2015, with the goal of further promoting innovation while enhancing consumer protection.

That may sound good for the consumer and the fintech sector, but it makes banks’ current situation even more tenuous. The sector is already pummeled by low interest rates, increasing KYC/AML costs and flourishing competition. Now, it has to invest in further compliance, and watch while its main competitive advantage is eaten away.

What main competitive advantage? Access to your information.

After 2018, when PSD2 comes into effect, banks have to share your data with third parties.

For end users, this streamlines payments and lowers costs. For innovative businesses, it gives them instant access to a significant resource: specific and detailed information about potential clients.

Retailers will be able to ask you for permission to access your bank account – the payment will be directly between your bank and the retailer. No intermediaries. Investment services will have access to your financial history and be able to offer more tailored advice. Payment portals will be able to compete for the lowest fees and creatively combine financial and social functions. Aggregators will be able to display all your financial information in one place, regardless of how many banks you work with.

Just think how attractive all that data is for service providers.

(There’s some other stuff in there as well, such as tighter control on credit card charges, greater protection for non-EU payments, unconditional refunds on direct debits… all good news for the consumer, not so much for the banks.)

What does that mean for blockchain development?

Basically, PSD2 is about the sharing of sensitive data with a network. Right now, the law envisions the transfers being handled through Application Programming Interface (APIs), code that gives third parties access.

On a blockchain, the distribution could be handled in an open, seamless and secure manner. Banks, clients, retailers and fintech services could all use the same system to share information. Access would be limited to network participants (who would have to jump through some hoops to join), transparency would ensure good behavior, and decentralized storage would enhance security.

This has to be preferable to a system in which banks (reluctantly) cede the information to any approved entity. Or a system littered with targeted APIs with limited interoperability. Or one in which the information is stored in centralized (hackable) silos.

Furthermore, a blockchain-based system would have lower operating costs than a distributed database, since less verification will be needed each time the data crosses over to another platform.

Lower operating costs will be crucial, given the tightening squeeze on banks’ profit margins.

While banks are currently preparing for this seismic change on their current systems, the appeal of a blockchain alternative is likely to encourage even more research and pilots than are already going on. Incorporation of a decentralized, transparent solution may shift from being a nice-to-have, when-we’re-absolutely-sure option to an increasingly pressing imperative. While blockchain technology is still new and has many hurdles to overcome (not least, regulatory), and while the cost of implementation is likely to be substantial, the need to adapt to a new financial paradigm could well be the catalyst that the sector has been waiting for.

We could be on the verge of a shift in blockchain interest. Already high among banks, it could jump up a notch to imperative.

# What is Open Banking and PSD2? WIRED explains

[ROWLAND MANTHORPE](http://www.wired.co.uk/profile/rowland-manthorpe) 9 February 2018

**Open Banking (aka PSD2) forces the nine biggest UK banks to open up their precious data, which could mean big changes for the way we bank. Our need-to-know Open Banking guide explains what the changes mean for you.**

Not much changes in banking in the UK. Sure, there are occasional new ideas – ATMs; apps; contactless payments – but decade after decade the fundamentals remain the same. Over 80 per cent of us bank with Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Santander or Royal Bank of Scotland. We find our bank as a teenager and stick with it for life.

Now that could be about to change, thanks to a new directive called Open Banking, which comes into force on 13 January 2018. This is the start of a programme designed to open up banking data. It might not sound like much, but it could transform the way we move and use money.

Like any large initiative, Open Banking has had its problems. (For more on its complex politics, [read our deep dive on the history of the project](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/psd2-future-of-banking).) Perhaps as a result, it’s been less than energetically marketed – a recent survey from consumer group Which? found that 92 per cent of respondents hadn’t even heard of it. Other polls suggest people find the idea of data sharing scary.

Imran Gulamhuseinwala, [head of Open Banking Limited](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/open-banking-market-problems-fintech-expert), the non-profit coordinating the system, admits that “it's going to take a while for us to see really new, very different services.” But, he says, once the system’s up and running, “it's going to be revolutionary.” Many across the industry agree.

So what does Open Banking – or PSD2 (Second Payment Services Directive), as it’s sometimes known – mean in everyday terms? To clear things up, here's WIRED's guide to Open Banking.

### What is Open Banking exactly?

Open Banking forces the UK’s nine biggest banks – HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Danske, Lloyds and Nationwide – to release their data in a secure, standardised form, so that it can be shared more easily between authorised organisations online.

This data includes some simple records, such as the location of branches and the exact details of certain banking products. This first part of Open Banking went live in March 2017. It should make it easier to find banks with disabled access, for instance, or compare the features of different personal and business accounts in order to get the best deal.

The more important release concerns the data contained in transactions. Banks hold the authoritative record of everything we spend, lend and borrow – everything from electricity bills to mortgage payments to weekly spend on train travel and coffee – but, for the most part, they don’t make much use of it.

Open Banking makes it possible to pass this rich information to third parties, who can use it to create new products (more on this later). It’s not an app or a service in its own right. It’s a way of facilitating data sharing.

Who does the sharing? The account holder, who must give their explicit approval to any exchange. (Or, alternatively, decide not to use it at all.) As Gulamhuseinwala puts it: “we're giving consumers control over their data.”

OPEN BANKING / PSD2 SUMMARY

- WHEN DOES THE NEW REGULATION START?

  The law comes into force on January 13, 2018 – but we won't start seeing new services until March at the earliest. Updates will follow over the next two years.


- WHO WILL ENFORCE IT IN THE UK?

  The system is being set up by Open Banking Limited, a non-profit created specially for the task. However, enforcement rests with the Competition & Markets Authority. Protection for consumers will be done by the banks (for payments) or the Information Commissioner's Office (for data).


- WHAT'S NEW?

  Short term, the system should make it easier to view your finances, take out loans and other financial products, and pay for things online. In the long term it could introduce an entirely new relationship to banking – but that future is probably some way off.


- WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

  In technical terms, the system is at least as secure as existing services. But it hasn’t been very well communicated to the public, so people could be put off by scare stories. This will benefit the incumbent banks.

### Why is Open Banking being introduced?

Banking in the UK has some big problems. Gulamhuseinwala lists them off: “People are paying too much for their overdrafts; money is sat in current accounts not earning interest; there's not enough switching.”

After years failing to change this situation, the Competition and Markets Authority brought in Open Banking with the intention of increasing competition and innovation in the market. It comes along with several more immediate measures, such as a cap on overdraft charges (albeit one set by the banks themselves), but is by far the most radical measure being introduced.

Open Banking also part of a sweeping piece of European legislation known as the second Payment Services Directive, or PSD2. Sometimes the two get confused: essentially, Open Banking is the UK version of PSD2. The difference is that whereas PSD2 requires banks to open up their data to third parties, Open Banking dictates that they do so in a standard format.

This makes it much easier to use, so it should help startups (or the technology divisions of banks) create innovative new products. The exact nature of these products is actually a bit of a mystery – when Google put out its maps data, who could have foreseen Uber? But at this stage it’s possible to see three distinct trends.

### 1. Money management

At the moment, if you’ve got accounts with two different banks, then you have to look at them separately, because the banks’ systems are resolutely incompatible. Open Banking will let you see them at the same time, which should make it easier to manage money.

Banks and startups see an opportunity and are already building apps, usually dashboards where you get a view of your ingoings and outgoings. Dutch bank ING has an app called [Yolt](https://www.yolt.com/). HSBC has sent out its “HSBC Beta” app to 10,000 customers.

### 2. Lending

When you take out a loan, you have to show details of your finances to prove you’re good for it. Open Banking will let you provide that information online – for instance, by giving an investor one-off access to 12 months income and spending history.

There are services that already do this, but in order to use them you have to hand over your login details – this method will be more secure. It will also be more accurate, which should help people with what are known as “thin files”. (For instance if you haven’t worked or been in the country long.)

Like many of the changes brought about by Open Banking, this kind of data transfer should help small businesses (SMEs). Innovation foundation Nesta has been holding [a challenge prize for startups](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/open-banking-nesta-open-up-challenge-finalists) to develop new tools specifically for SMEs. One of the winning products – from loan comparison startup Funding Options – lets SMEs share bank account data digitally.

"A perennial absurdity is that SMEs end up scanning their paper bank statements, only for the data to be manually re-entered into the underwriting systems of modern online lenders," says founder Conrad Ford.

### 3. Payments

The current payment system is very complicated. At present, when you buy your nephew a Minions doll on Amazon, the retailer contacts an “acquirer”’, such as WorldPay or Global Payments, which gets in touch with Visa or MasterCard to take the payment from your account. Cue much fumbling around with cards and passwords.

By opening up banks’ data, Open Banking makes it possible to pay directly from a bank account – which should be both quicker and (since the various middlemen each charge for their service) cheaper. The bank authenticates the purchase without involving other organisations.

### Is it safe?

From a technical point of view, Open Banking is at least as safe as online banking. APIs – the technology used to move the data – are trusted and the law requires account providers to use strong customer authentication, a procedure which allows the payment service provider to verify the identity of both the user and the service.

Only startups that have been approved by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) will be allowed to use the system. However, just like online banking, increased movement of data does offer opportunities for scammers, who might try and trick people into sending over their data.

The key thing to remember: anyone using an Open Banking service will not need to share their banking login or password with anyone but the bank. This is actually an improvement on existing services, which sometimes require this as a workaround for existing incompatibility.

If something does go wrong with a payment, your bank should be able to help you get a refund. If someone misuses your data, then the case is subject to data protection laws and you will be able to complain to [the Information Commissioner’s Office](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018).

### What’s the big deal?

If you’ve got this far and you’re wondering why Open Banking is such a big deal, that’s not surprising. Like the internet itself, its benefits aren’t immediately obvious – if someone told you about a bookseller with no shops, it would be hard to picture Amazon.

The iteration of Open Banking that arrives in 2018 isn’t likely to bring that future into being. The limited initial scope only includes current account data, with credit cards and other payment accounts added slowly over the next two years. There are also likely to be difficulties with integration. “I think initially it will be pretty clunky and pretty slow and hard to use and kind of broken unfortunately,” says Tom Blomfield, founder of challenger bank Monzo. “It will not be this great epiphany.”

Nevertheless, the system has the potential to upend the way we bank, disrupting the sector in the same way as media or retail. It could, for instance, enable digital-only banks that manage money automatically via intelligent software. Whether this is a dystopian or utopian future depends on your perspective – either way, it just became more likely.

### What’s happening right now?

This question is harder to answer than you might expect, and has actually been the cause of some confusion. One common, [quite understandable](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/about-us/news/uks-open-banking-launch-13-january-2018/), misconception is that Open Banking launched on January 13, 2018. It didn’t. That was the day the regulation came into force, beginning the second stage of the process.

Open Banking is currently in what is described as a [“managed roll out.”](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/about-us/news/open-banking-begins-managed-roll/) This means can apply to the FCA and be accepted as approved third parties in order to access the APIs. Once their certification has gone through – and you can check to see if they have been on the [FCA’s register](https://register.fca.org.uk/) – then they can connect up to the new system and begin testing their products.

Open Banking Limited says we will start to see “a dynamic new range of financial services” from March 2018. We don’t have a more specific date than that.

One hitch: despite ample warning, six big high-street banks, including Barclays and HSBC, managed to [miss their deadlines](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42691661). The CMA gave them a six-week extension and is monitoring the situation.

Meanwhile, there has been a lot of poorly-informed coverage in the national press, mostly based on [negative briefings from Natwest](https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2018/jan/13/open-banking-app-data). For some, this raises questions about the viability of the project. However, at present all the interested parties insist the project will go ahead as planned. Only time will tell...

# PSD2 to Accelerate Digital Revolution, Blockchain Adoption

[Alicia Naumoff](https://cointelegraph.com/news/psd2-to-accelerate-digital-revolution#) JUN 09, 2016

**Aiming at accelerating innovation and developing a unified payment services sector, the European Commission has adopted the [Payment Services Directive (PSD2)](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366), which is expected to bring vital changes.**

## What is PSD2?

Lately, regulators have been increasingly focussing on ensuring consumer protection, competition, and security in the area of financial services.

The PSD2 is a data and technology-driven directive, which was introduced as a way to respond to the changes in the landscape of payment services since the introduction of the original directive in 2007, and to drive further improvements in payment services across Europe.

The revised version includes a number of changes and enhancements to the original paper, with the main goal of providing clarity, efficiency and ease-of-use of European payment services.

## Ensuring access, liability and transparency

The directive significantly extends the scope of the original PSD regulations beyond Europe and revises the definition of a ‘Payment Institution.’

Other features of the reform package include: new rules on access to payment accounts, liability allocation provisions, transparency requirements and customer authentication measures.

The clauses included in the directive reflect the growing number of account aggregators - businesses that enable customers to access different online banking accounts including credit cards, current and savings accounts using a single online portal, and other fintech companies starting in the payments services sector.

According to the directive, under the new regime, businesses which provide and maintain customer’s payment accounts are required to give certain third parties which have a license to provide payment services access to customers' account information, providing the customer has given their explicit consent to that access.

The right of customers to be provided with information which properly informs them about the extent of their access is also extended.

## What is there in the new regulation?

Under the new regulation, payment services are banned from placing restrictions on third-party account information access. In addition, payment services are prohibited from treating payments which go through third-parties differently (e.g. applying added charges, treating them as being of lower priority, etc.) from those which come directly from customers.

Separate provisions have been included to cover payments made under framework contracts which provide for a series of payment transactions and those which do not.

Now both the payer and payee in a transaction are entitled to receive information from their respective payment service providers about the charges applied to transactions. EU countries are also required to ensure payment service users are given information on any charges or interest applied.

Before each transaction, under a framework contract payment service, providers are required to provide customers with explicit information on the maximum execution time and the charges payable by the payer and, where applicable, a breakdown of the amounts of any charges.  

## Strong customer authentication required

The directive contains significant restrictions of rules on payment service user authentication, with the purpose of ensuring that payment service providers  can be confident that the people using their services are who they say they are. Therefore, payment service providers are required to apply strong customer authentication when payers initiate an electronic payment transaction.

The proposals, however, would allow the [European Banking Authority (EBA)](http://www.eba.europa.eu/) the scope to set guidelines on exemptions to this general rule.

Given that security measures are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, and that they are constantly driving towards a frictionless experience for consumers, some conflict between the direction that industry and regulators wish to travel in is expected.

It is still unclear if, or to what extent, consumers will benefit from the mandated security procedures given that the liability provisions largely protect consumers from loss. Payment service providers who fail to apply strong customer authentication for payments made online or over the phone cannot require payers to bear any financial consequences unless those payers themselves act fraudulently. In all circumstances where strong customer authentication is required, the Council said payment service providers must adopt specific security requirements to protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the payment service users’ personalised security credentials.

## Golden opportunity to accelerate the digital revolution

The financial sector is one of the most complicated and highly regulated, therefore it might be hard for many to greet the introduction of new rules with open arms. At first sight it might seem that regulators have made the rules of the game stricter and forcibly unveiled the backstage of payment services scene. On the other hand, PSD2 certainly expands the space for development for financial institutions, once they embrace adopted regulations and revise their growth strategies.

Regulators actually give banks and financial institutions a golden opportunity to accelerate the digital revolution they ought to embrace - not for the sake of compliance, but for the sake of growth. Some large players of the fintech arena have already started making use of the new regulatory framework.

Yobie Benjamin from [Token ](http://token.io/)shared his perspective at [Arctic15](http://www.arctic15.com/),  in Helsinki last week:

> “We have always been interested in building the next generation global payment system, and the opportunity showed itself with the introduction of PSD2. The European financial sector unites around 19,000 registered banks, which are regulated by the European Central Bank. Now all of them are required to open up their system for other players with the aim of increasing regulation and competition. It would be silly not to use the opportunity to ensure development of the sector. We decided to team up and write software for compliance with PSD2”.

Yobie explains that the most magic was in the fact that in order to comply with the new regulatory framework, all European banks have to be connected to one single system.

Working on the software, the team found out that connecting all registered European banks, large American and Chinese banks automatically connect to the system as well, since they all operate in Europe. Therefore, they basically created the basis for a new global payment system.

One lesson can be drawn here - if earlier financial institutions had doubts as tp whether to go digital or not, the directive basically forces them to start doing things differently.

Players in the fintech arena now have the chance to go ‘all in’ and excel at creating the new experiences possible in the new digital market context.

# PSD2: Understanding the new payments regulation in Europe

[Sundeep Tengur](https://blogs.sas.com/content/author/sundeeptengur/) August 18, 2017

The revised EU Payment Services Directive (**PSD2**) has been a focal point for the financial services industry over the last couple of years and its adoption is set to revolutionise the payment ecosystem in Europe. New entrants, innovative technologies and increased regulation are already posing major challenges to traditional banks as they need to do more than ever before to retain their revenue streams, meet growing customer expectations and counter the erosion of their competitive edge. So why is PSD2 such a game-changer?

In short, PSD2 calls for banks to open their data infrastructure to third parties so that the latter can provide better products and payment services to customers. This is unprecedented and many traditional banks perceive PSD2 to be disruptive, but in fact these new payment offerings have been sprouting for quite some time, powered by the FinTech industry. The revised directive has been put in place to provide a regulatory framework to ensure best practice and adequate governance.

Here’s a condensed view of the main PSD2 themes:

### Market integration

One of the strategic objectives of PSD2 is to align all member states into a **single digital market**. This initiative already started under the first Payments Services Directive and with the Single Eurozone Payments Area (SEPA) which aimed at improving cross-border payments and creating a unified market.

The second Payments Services Directive will further this agenda by encompassing smaller payment institutions and relevant FinTechs, many of which were previously unregulated and operating on the fringes of the payments services spectrum. They now all fall within the extended definition of a ‘payment institution’ under PSD2. Established banking entities are also invited to embrace the opportunity by offering both existing and new services to customers of other banks, i.e. to be become FinTech players themselves. A fine example is Payconiq, a mobile payment offering powered by several banks: ING, KBC and Belfius.

### Democratising the access to payments

Another key tenet of PSD2 is to widen access to payments. To achieve this, the regulation defines two new types of third-party payment providers: namely account information service providers and payment initiation service providers. These new players will add value on top of the core services offered by traditional banks (called account servicing payment service providers under PSD2), therefore extending the set of existing payment services providers.

Account information service providers are entities that can connect to customer accounts and only retrieve information whereas payment initiation service providers can connect to the banks’ systems through secure channels to initiate payment requests. These new players will offer consumers more choice compared to the traditional banking landscape and help boost the economy by generating revenue through a wider range of services.

### Increased consumer protection

PSD2 introduces several measures which will protect consumer rights and improve customer service around payments:

- **Surcharging:** PSD2 will ban surcharging for the use of payment instruments covered by the Interchange Fee Regulation and payment services covered by the SEPA Regulation. For example, companies such as airlines or event organizers will not be allowed to charge an additional card fee on top of the transaction value.
- PSD2 will also offer better protection around **pre-authorisation** for card payments where the final amount is not known in advance. For transactions such as hotel bookings or car rentals, the merchant will only be able to lock funds to a limit approved by the cardholder and has to unlock same without undue delay after the final transaction amount is known or after having received the payment order.
- PSD2 will provide the legislative basis to an unconditional **refund right** for direct debit payments, for a period of 8 weeks from the date when the funds were debited.
- Consumers will be **better protected against fraud **and other abuses and payment incidents as the amount they would be obliged to pay for an **unauthorised payment** will be brought down from €150 to €50, with exceptions for gross negligence or fraud perpetrated by the payer.
- Consumers will be protected for transactions even where the payment service provider is located **outside the European Economic Area (EEA)** as well as for payments in **non-EEA currencies**.
- PSD2 requires that service providers have adequate **dispute resolution procedures**. payment services providers will be required to respond to payment complaints within a standard 15-day period.

### Increased security

There's no doubt that PSD2 will offer great opportunities, but these new payment and information access mechanisms can be vulnerable to threats such as fraud, data breaches and cyber-attacks. The regulation therefore seeks to establish a security baseline to help mitigate those threats and secure consumer assets. The main security highlights are;

- **Secure authentication**: PSD2 requires the use of ‘strong customer authentication’ for online payment transactions. The minimum requirements are for the use of 2FA – two-factor authentication, a norm already widely adopted by the banking industry.
- Payment Services Providers will need to provide a **security policy document**, including a detailed risk assessment, which details the steps taken to protect customers from fraud and data breaches.
- Payment services providers will be required to set up **incident management** procedures to detect and report major operational and security incidents. There are also requirements for annual review and reporting to regulatory bodies.
- Although account servicing payment service providers must allow access to third-party payment providers, all payment services providers must ensure that adequate security measures have been implemented to protect the **confidentiality and integrity** of the payment service user's access credentials.

There are other security considerations around the regulatory technical standards (RTS), including the strong customer authentication and the secure open standards of communication. It is expected all stakeholders will have a clearer view of these requirements with the publication of the RTS in the last quarter of 2018.

### Not long left…

PSD2, with its extensive scope, is regarded as establishing a baseline for the future of banking, rather than being a mere regulatory piece. It is a game-changing initiative that will bring along numerous opportunities to facilitate access to payments and help deliver a better customer experience. PSD2 must be transposed into national law by Member States before 13 January 2018, which means that the legal provisions will apply from that date. The next six months or so will be challenging for businesses as they navigate their way towards PSD2 compliance.
