# PSD2: Questions Resurface Over Credential Sharing

**Banks and fintechs remain at odds over whether consumers will be able to share their online banking login credentials with third parties under incoming EU-wide security standards.**

Several projects currently underway in Europe to develop application programming interfaces (APIs) for third-party access have used a “redirect” model for carrying out customer authentication.

That means a consumer wishing to use a payment initiation service when shopping online, for example, would be forwarded onto a login screen operated by their bank rather than share their login details with the third party.

However, after [complaints](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/%E2%80%98authentication-redirection%E2%80%99-proves-problematic-under-psd2) that would result in a clumsy and fragmented checkout process, the European Commission made reference to the practice in changes to regulatory technical standards that will accompany the revised [Payment Services Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal) (PSD2).

It said that banks [would not be allowed](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-takes-tough-line-psd2-%E2%80%98redirection%E2%80%99) to obstruct third parties’ business models, [giving the example](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-adopts-psd2-technical-standards) of “imposing redirection” as a practice that may result in a bank’s API not gaining the approval of its national regulator.

Speaking in a personal capacity at an industry event last week, European Commission unit head Ralf Jacob reiterated that message.

“If, for instance, there was a redirection to a page that was not properly formatted or would not really fit into the customer journey as designed by the third-party provider, there would be a problem and we would not like to see that,” he said.

However, Jacob said that some industry participants or national regulators, particularly in Nordic countries, were alarmed as they “interpreted that as a prohibition on redirection”.

There are two widely used alternatives to the redirect currently on the market; both are variants of the “pass through” model, which involves a third party transmitting authentication details to the bank.

The first alternative — an embedded pass-through — has long been used by existing payment initiation services, which collect a user’s login details and transmit them to the account-holding bank.

A decoupled pass-through, however, involves parallel authentication by the bank and the third party, without the customer journey being taken out of the third party’s hands.

That arrangement can be used in arrangements where there is an external authentication system, such as a national ID database.

In situations where a decoupled pass-through is not feasible, third parties are calling for the embedded pass-through to be made available.

“Customer authentication via redirection to [banks’] websites would be a conversion killer,” said Ralf Ohlhausen, a director at fintech firm PPRO and member of the Euro Retail Payments Board's (ERPB) working group on payment initiation.

“That would deprive third-party providers from offering their own end-to-end service via mobile app, and it would really only work for e-commerce.”

Ohlhausen suggested that if the commission did not trust payment initiation service providers to handle users’ online banking login credentials safely, it would have explicitly prohibited credential sharing in the level one text.

Existing interbank payment services that use a redirect model, such as iDEAL in the Netherlands, are not considered third parties under PSD2, he added.

Gijs Boudewijn, chairman of the European Banking Federation’s Payments System Committee, admitted there “is a lot of confusion” around the legality of credential sharing.

“Our understanding is that [banks] can mandate the current strong customer authentication methods through a redirect, but it must be well implemented in the API and provide for a good customer journey,” he explained.

“Otherwise it might create an ‘obstacle’, which might be a reason for national competent authorities not to grant an [exemption for the fallback mechanism](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/eba-takes-technical-standards-battle-commission).

“That is the incentive for [banks] to provide good APIs, which I believe will be one of the issues we will have to address in the new API evaluation group.”

The evaluation group met for the first time last week, with the commission [hoping](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/psd2-commission-pins-hopes-new-api-working-group) it will be able to develop access mechanisms that are satisfactory both to banks and third-party providers.

According to a [report](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/retpaym/shared/pdf/8th-ERPB-meeting/PIS_working_group_report.pdf?483e4d28242cd84322850a01e549d116) by the ERPB payment initiation working group published in November last year, the national APIs under development in the UK, Poland and Slovakia are all built around a redirect model.

France’s STET project uses a pass-through, while the Berlin Group API can support a redirect model or either pass-through option.
