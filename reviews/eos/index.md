## EOS: Powerful infrastructure for decentralized applications

The EOS.IO software introduces a new blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This is achieved by creating an operating system-like construct upon which applications can be built. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across hundreds of CPU cores or clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.

SCALABLE

- Support thousands of Commercial Scale DApps
- Parallel Execution

- Separates Authentication from Execution

FLEXIBLE

- Freeze and Fix Broken Applications
- Generalized Role-based Permissions
- Web Assembly

USABLE

- Web Toolkit for Interface Development
- Self Describing Interfaces
- Self Describing Database Schemes
- Declarative Permission Scheme
