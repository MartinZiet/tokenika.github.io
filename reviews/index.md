## EOS

#### [Powerful infrastructure for decentralized applications](eos/index.md)

EOS introduces a new blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across hundreds of CPU cores or clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.

## Qtum

#### [Smart-contract compatible blockchain that can natively run both Bitcoin-based and Ethereum-based applications](qtum/index.md)

Qtum will be a proof-of-stake (PoS), smart-contract compatible blockchain that can natively run both Bitcoin-based and Ethereum-based applications. The protocol uses Bitcoin’s UXTO model of storing transactions, while also supporting oracles and two types of smart contracts. Applications built for Bitcoin, Etheruem, or either of their derivatives, should be able to port easily.

## Tezos

#### [Zdecentralizowana platforma smart-kontraktowa z formalnie weryfikowalnym językiem programowania i ze zintegrowanym systemem samorządności](tezos/index.md)

Tezos jest niezależny od innych blockchainów, a jego kod źródłowy zbudowano od zera (czyli nie jest to klon innego projektu). Do tworzenia kontraktów wymagane jest użycie specjalnego języka skryptowego (odpowiednik języka *Solidity* na ETH).

### [Bitcoin](bitcoin/index.md)

#### Czy Craig Wright to ktoś więcej niż uzurpator? I czy Bitcoin jest *Turing complete*?

Wbrew pozorom te dwa zagadnienia łączą się ze sobą. Jeśli twierdzenie Craiga Wrighta w zakresie bitcoinowego *Turing completeness* okaże się prawdziwe (na co się zanosi), to oznacza to, że ma on wiedzę i umiejętności sugerujące jego aktywny udział w powstaniu Bitcoina.

## Golem

#### [Decentralized supercomputer and a software service marketplace](golem/index.md)

Golem is a very interesting project for many reasons with an end goal of building a decentralized supercomputer and a software service marketplace for the next generation of the web (web 3.0, aka the decentralised web). It’s very ambitious, they have an open and inclusive approach and in the end I think they will contribute a lot back to the Ethereum community.

## IOTA

#### [Micro-transaction crypto-token optimized for the Internet-of-Things](iota/index.md)

IOTA aims to become the backbone of Economy-of-Things and the world standard for micro-transactions. Its creators maintain they've achieved remarkable results in such important areas as: scalability, storage, bandwidth and fees (actually there are no fees, just like Steem). IOTA’s design diverged radically from other blockchain crypto-currencies. It's a blockchain but without blocks - it makes use of Directed Acyclic Graph.
