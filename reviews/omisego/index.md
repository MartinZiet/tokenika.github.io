On August 7, 2017, [OmiseGO](https://www.omise.co/omisego-airdrop-update), an Ethereum blockchain-based payment solution company, announced that it would issue 5 percent of the total OMG tokens it has [set aside for Ethereum holders](https://www.ethnews.com/preview/indian-inter-disciplinary-committee-submits-cryptocurrency-report) in the near future via an Airdrop or massive disbursement to blockchain walletaddresses.

OmiseGo is an e-wallet and payment platform operating across currencies and assets.

OmiseGo will create a platform for managing fiat/cryptocurrency/other assets. It builds a liquid on-chain decentralized exchange and off-chain payment network to make its ecosystem work.

OMG tokens will be native currency of the OmiseGo blockchain. OmiseGo is going to be a new blockchain.

With OmiseGo the users will be able to manage: fiat tokens, cryptocurrencies, other assets (such as loyalty and reward points).

### Opportunities

- There is a genuine need for a decentralized platform in the payment space, especially in Southeast Asia where 73% of the population are unbanked.
- Omise has [already ﻿﻿raised over $25 million from VCs and banks](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/omise-lands-17-5m-series-b-to-expand-its-stripe-like-service-in-southeast-asia/), so it passed the scrutiny of professional investors.
- There is a strong network effect in play here. The more merchants and users Omise GO can bring onto the ecosystem, the more valuable the network is. Omise GO has demonstrated success on the merchant side – it is already helping 6,000 merchants in Asia Pacific.
- The company has shown good traction - the business development team is already engaged with major global and regional banks such as SBI Holdings, Mizuho Bank Ltd. and Bank of Ayudhya, as well as mobile and e-money service providers such as TrueMoney, to design and provide Omise GO services.
- It has a very clear and detailed development roadmap in the whitepaper – this company is not raising money for the sake of raising money.
- A very strong advisor team – this is one of the two ICO projects that Vitalik officially admits to have an advisor role in.

### Concerns

- They are building their own blockchain. However, the OmiseGo blockchain will be closely integrated into Ethereum mainnet. 
- Their development roadmap is pretty ambitious, including carrying out research on proof-of-stake and develop core consensus mechanisms for scaling Ethereum smart contracts for cross-blockchain use. If there are any setbacks in the R&D, the full potential for the project cannot be realized.
- The project is targeting the poorer part of the population, so the transaction fees generated by the tokens may not be as high as expected, as least in the beginning.
- Omise GO’s platform is a two-sided market– it needs to sign up both merchants and users in order to be successful. If they are unsuccessful at bringing on board either side of the market, the network effect would diminish substantially.

### How can token ﻿holders ﻿make money?

Owning OMG tokens buys the right to validate this blockchain, within its consensus rules. Transaction fees on the network including (but not limited to) payment, interchange, trading, and clearinghouse use, are given to non-faulty validators who enforce bonded contract states.

### What Is OmiseGO?

OmiseGO is a company that has created a financial technology for use in mainstream digital wallets. That technology allows for real-time, peer-to-peer exchanges and payments. It promises to work “agnostically” across jurisdictions and organizational silos, and across both fiat money and decentralized currencies.

The goal of OmiseGO is to enable financial inclusion while disrupting existing financial institutions.

OmiseGO wants to make it cheaper to send and receive payments, and cheaper to exchange currencies – whether you’re dealing with fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.

OmiseGO has not yet been launched. However, it’s scheduled for launch later this year (2017). Prior to launch, OmiseGO will release tokens called OmiseGO tokens, or OMG tokens.

### How Does OmiseGO Work?

There are two core products in the OmiseGO ecosystem: the blockchain and the wallet.

OmiseGO will enable decentralized exchanges on a public blockchain at high volume and low cost. Using this platform, OmiseGO will provide a “next-generation value transfer service operating across currencies and asset types.”

Anyone will be able to use the OmiseGO network (connected to the Ethereum main network) to conduct financial transactions.

Some of the possible financial transactions to perform with OmiseGO include payments, remittances, payroll deposit, B2B commerce, supply-chain finance, loyalty programs, asset management and trading, and other on-demand services.

The platform will also make it easier for millions of users to participate in the cryptocurrency world. They’ll be able to easily switch from using fiat money to using decentralized currencies – like ETH, BTC, and others.

The ultimate goal of OmiseGO is to create a state of perfect competition in the world of currencies:

“The OmiseGO network is intrinsically agnostic between fiat and decentralized money: as far as adoption and usage go, the system is constructed so that the best currencies will win.”

By removing barriers between currency transactions and trading, OmiseGO ensures that the best currencies rise to the top.

### OmiseGO Features

OmiseGO emphasizes the following three core features across both its wallet and its blockchain:

- Access: No bank account is needed to access the exchange, and OmiseGO will have nationally-licensed full reserves.
- Scalability: Instant settlements and low costs will be key features of the OmiseGO platform.
- Security: OmiseGO offers decentralized currencies and decentralized fiat token custody.

### OmiseGO Blockchain Features

The blockchain comes with the following core features:

- Decentralized exchange
- Liquidity provider mechanism
- Clearinghouse messaging network
- Asset-backed blockchain gateway
- Scalable and public (permissionless) blockchain
- Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus is bonded by the activities of the chain itself
- Highly performaning system that leverages interlinked blockchain construction
- Clearing and settlement occurs over the OmiseGO blockchain
- Costs of protecting transaction value are externalized to other chains “in ways that directly promote the value of those chains”

### OmiseGO Wallet Features

Right now, OmiseGO has a wallet SDK. That SDK promises to simplify the implementation of OmiseGO while also offering post-integration support “to get you to market faster and to help you stay ahead”.

It’s a white-label wallet, which means companies can implement the wallet in various ways across various industries. Using the wallet, users can trade fiat currencies freely alongside decentralized currencies.

The wallet gives you access to the Omise payment gateway, a credit and virtual cash card, top-ups over the counter and through direct debit, and real-time settlement.

Using the SDK, companies can create their own styles and designs or embed custom apps. The SDK can be used to make payments or transfers, for example, or to setup a loyalty and rewards points program.

Another key feature of the OmiseGO wallet is that it uses a distributed open protocol, making it easy for different wallets to communicate with one another to unlock the full power of mobile commerce.

Ultimately, the OmiseGO wallet SDK is designed to be as flexible as possible and can work to benefit you.

### What Are OMG Tokens?

Omise will sell OMG (OmiseGO) tokens at some point over the coming months. The tokens will allow token holders the rights to earn fees for validating transactions on a special type of Proof of Stake (PoS) network.

That network will have a decentralized exchange built into the blockchain, with consensus rules allowing deep interoperability with most other blockchains – including Ethereum and Bitcoin – while also offering a novel way to provide network economic security.

### About OmiseGO

OmiseGO, or Omise, was founded in 2013. The venture-backed company operates in Thailand, Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia. They also have rapid expansion plans to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

Forbes Thailand picked Omise as a “Fintech Rockstar” in November 2016.

Some of the key investors in Omise include SBI Investment, SMBC, Ascend Capital, SMDV, Golden Gate Ventures, and East Ventures.

### Conclusion

OmiseGO is an Ethereum-based payment and exchange platform that plans to revolutionize the world of finance as we know it. It’s a real-time, peer-to-peer value exchange and payment service that allows the best currency to rise to the top. The goal is to enable financial inclusion while disrupting existing institutions.

The OmiseGO network and digital wallet framework is scheduled to launch in Q4 2017.
