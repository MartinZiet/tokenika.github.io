# [ANN] Introducing SteemProjects.com - information about all Steem projects in one place!


https://steemitimages.com/DQmctCVKsWe5Tj8Zy6povAAupiwikSgwnKXUMoeFTrQ6a3m/28695636_1870721952939197_1601480229_o.jpg

From the very beginning of Steem, its biggest strength has always been the same: **great community**.  For the last 2 years hundreds of Steem-based projects have been created.

The number of projects is so huge that it's almost impossible to track even the most promising ones. The Steem ecosystem is still very young and quite difficult to grasp. The truth is that for any platform to be successful, every user needs to be able to find an app that suites them the most. 

Therefore I decided to create:

What is Steem Projects about?

# A detailed description of every project

One of the goals is to show to the world how big and active our community is. Every project has a dedicated page, where one can find the most important information about it, such as:

* The name and description of the project
* Links to the project website, its announcement, the team's contact details
* A special section for developers: link to the repository and basic stats
* And my favorite: _the project timeline_

And...

* A gallery showcasing various functionalities:

# How to find your favorite project?

There are a couple of ways...

### Dynamic search

# Personal favorites

When you find a project you like, make sure to add it to a special list called _favorites_ :)

<center>
![add to favorites.gif](https://steemitimages.com/DQmfKJdv9ZC4J7sWkZ6L2pPhZ5oQdM9CqV3szxZwMgyjjXx/add%20to%20favorites.gif)
</center>

In the near future SteemProjects will also be able to send weekly customized newsletters about all updates related to the projects from your list of favorites.

# Compare projects with comparison grids!

</center>

For example you can compare [SteemProjects](https://SteemProjects.com/) with [SteemTools](https://SteemTools.com/):

<center>[![Selection_268.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQoKvB9vdJj6v4PH52B3mvAVnZzCrWvfj1GHLfEQyYjxt/Selection_268.png)](https://steemprojects.com/grids/g/steem-directories/)</center>

or you can compare different tools aiming to help you create a Steem Account:

<center>[![Selection_269.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmf5Yt2Hkw1TNEPEcSj4XR3tq5fpB2eQkh7UL9Qht494Kd/Selection_269.png)](https://steemprojects.com/grids/g/creating-account/)</center>

For now there are just a couple of hardcoded examples of comparison grids. Preparing a new comparison grid for different kind of tools requires in-depth knowledge about the ecosystem, therefore in the next release I intend to add the possibility of adding/editing new grids by the users, on their own. Maybe there will be even some contest for best comparison grids :)

# IMPORTANT: You can add/edit projects on your own!

The Steem ecosystem is growing rapidly. No-one is able to single-handedly keep up with adding new projects to this website. So if you want to help, please [read the guideline](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@noisy/pre-release-tutorial-how-to-add-edit-a-project-on-steemprojects-com), then click _Add project_:

...and start filling out the forms:

# The Team of SteemProjects.com

It would be impossible to create such a project alone, therefore I would like to say big thank you to all my team mates, who have helped me to deliver this project:

<center>![Selection_259.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWEmaNYrgQMf8pK29vzTztHmaYfRBT2iuLCijvuv7JBGc/Selection_259.png)</center>

I would like to highlight the exceptional role of @andrejcibik, who was always there whenever I needed his graphic skills.

And last but not least, special thanks to my wife @lenka, who not only needed to look after our child, while I was coding, but also decided to help me in a more active way, by testing the entire application on multiple devices and giving me tons of suggestions.
