\href{http://tokenika.io/}{Tokenika} is an IT company set up by a group of crypto-space entrepreneurs based in Poland, one of the largest crypto-markets in Europe

We've been closely following all of Dan Larimer's DPOS-based projects since 2014, so it was a natural choice for us to align our business activity with EOS from its very inception. As we see a lot of business potential in EOS, since June 2017 we've been making various contributions to the emerging ecosystem:

\begin{itemize}
\item EOS development tools, including \href{https://github.com/tokenika/teos}{TEOS} , an alternative, cross-platform programming interface for EOS.
\item Building our own in-house expertise, as well as partnering with established IT companies interested in entering the blockchain domain (e.g. \href{https://aply.eu/}{Aply}, \href{https://ragnarson.com/}{Ragnarson}, \href{http://espeo.eu/}{Espeo}).
\item Consultation services for companies seriously considering building or migrating their large-scale businesses to EOS (e.g. \href{http://parsecfrontiers.com/}{Parsec Frontiers}, \href{http://buildercommerce.com/}{Builder Commerce}, \href{http://justdrive.co/}{Just Drive}).
\item Building relationships with VC funds interested in investing in blockchain-based startups utilizing EOS (e.g. \href{http://speedupgroup.com/en/}{Speedup Group}).
\item Presenting EOS at high-profile events (e.g. \href{http://connectwarsaw.org/}{Blockchain Connect} in Warsaw) and several meetups both in Poland (e.g. \href{https://www.facebook.com/events/903326303125907/}{Warsaw}, \href{https://www.meetup.com/Wroclaw-Blockchain-Meetup/events/246349912/}{Wroclaw}, \href{https://www.facebook.com/events/160585741214328/}{Lodz}) \& Europe (e.g. \href{https://steemit.com/eos/@bitspace/bitspace-hosts-scandinavia-s-first-ever-eos-meetup-in-oslo-norway}{Oslo}).
\item Active on social media: \href{https://steemit.com/@tokenika}{Steem}, \href{https://twitter.com/tokenika_io}{Twitter} \& \href{https://www.facebook.com/groups/EOSPolska/}{Facebook}.
\end{itemize} 
 
Apart from that, we've set out to create our own EOS dApp taking advantage of the opportunities created by \href{https://www.evry.com/en/news/articles/psd2-the-directive-that-will-change-banking-as-we-know-it/}{the European PSD2 legislation}.

Why are we making all those contributions? Our main medium-term goal is gaining reputation and getting elected as an EOS witness. We have the experience \& infrastructure required for this role thanks to close partnership with a successful \href{https://steemit.com/@gtg}{Steem witness}.

Now, we want to push it even further. As we've seen a lot of interest in EOS from large-scale businesses in Poland \& Europe, it makes perfect sense for us to expand the process of introducing EOS to them and assisting them to utilize it. And this is something we'd like to discuss with block.one - how to enable us to substantially expand our on-boarding activity and give our actions proper backing \& structure.
